Monster Hunter Wilds,very immersive game. you can cook a well-done steak on your GPU while you play and the hot blasts of air from your PC fans truly make you feel like you are in the desert. keep a bag of sand by your desk and periodically toss handfuls of it into the air to really complete the experience,positive
Monster Hunter Wilds,"I have played every monster hunter game since Tri at least twice, and I usually play to complete the HR100 or equivalent boss on every save. I also played the older live service games, Monster hunter frontier and Monster hunter online. Here are my thoughts on wilds (HR70/50 hours in game at time of writing):Positives-POOGIE IS BACKMonster hunter wilds is really fun, and anyone familiar with the series will like it a lot. The gameplay loop hasn't changed, and capcom has implemented a ton of quality of life changes that make it more accessible to people who want to hunt more and grind materials less.The new monsters are all really cool, along with their weapon and armor designs. Capcom does not miss when it comes to aesthetics in these games.As a veteran hunter, I was worried the combat in this game would not be as enjoyable as previous titles, and while hunts are the easiest they have ever been, the attacks and animations in this game FEEL SO GOOD you basically don't notice. I have not used seikret or mantels during combat to make it more challenging, and used un-upgraded starting armor through LR6, but throughout the whole story (both low and high rank) I only carted [died] about 3 times, and did not fail a single quest. I was planning on avoiding using focus mode and exploiting wounds as well, but honestly they are so fun and satisfying to use I would sacrifice the difficulty for the satisfaction. Despite the lack of difficulty, the gameplay loop and game feel is worth 70$ to me personally.The story in this game is... an improvement from previous entries. The characters, cutscenes, and storyline are more involved and compelling than previous installments, but to be honest, I don't think many people are playing monster hunter for a compelling story. unga bunga hammer go bonk, and all thatOverall, the game feel is impeccable, and I will probably end up putting at least a couple hundred hours into it before its G/Master rank expansion releases in a couple years. Capcom has already promised half a dozen or more free title updates over the next year that will include new monsters and loads of event quests and other things to do in the game. For me at least, the $70 is worth it to satiate my addiction to this series.Negatives-Performance is really bad. I have a Ryzen 9 5950x and a 3090 and I am playing this game at 4k high, raytracing off and getting 45FPS. This is playable for me because I spent a decade playing on a 3ds outdoors at 20 fps, but understandably many people are not willing to play a 70$ game below 60fps or able to afford a PC capable of more than 30fps.On top of the low framerates, graphical bugs are not uncommon either. I personally have experienced the ""black triangle"" 3 or 4 times in my 45 hours of gameplay, which causes a flashing black triangle to fill about a quarter of your screen for 20 seconds or so for no apparent reason, which makes the game almost unplayable while its happening.I have also seen the ""PS2 graphics"" bug, where some models appear to have about 100 polygons like OG Final Fantasy 7. For me this happened once after fast travelling and it resolved itself after about 3 seconds. I personally have not experienced any game crashes (I'm on the latest version of Windows 11 with the latest graphics drivers).In classic capcom fashion, the menus in this game are heinous.in particular, setting up multiplayer is particularly problematic until you figure out the system, so I will explain what you need to do to get it working the way you expect it too:Basically, you want to have your friends in a lobby AND a link party at the same time.The lobby is basically how you can see your friends in the overworld, while a link party allows you to go on quests together as a group. you can go on quests together using either one, but for the best experience, you want both.To set it up:1. you want one person to create a private lobby after selecting their save data on the home screen.2. after loading in to the game, that player should get the lobby ID by going to the member list screen (start -> tab 4, labelled ""communication"" -> member list). The lobby ID will be displayed on the right. This player should send that lobby ID to everyone they want to play with.3. The other players should select ""lobby search"" and then ""find a lobby based on ID"". (finding from in game or steam friends lists seems to have a 30% or less success rate, lobby ID works every time in my experience).4. After loading in to the lobby, one player should go back to the member list mentioned before, and go to the ""lobby"" tab, then select and invite the other players to a link party.5. The other players then need to accept the link party invite, either by holding the plus button on their controller after they receive the notification, or by going to start -> communication -> invites -> received invites.From here, players will be able to see eachother in the overworld (because they are in the same lobby) and will automatically be able to join quests the other players post (because of the link party). Keep in mind a private lobby can have 16 players but a link party is only 4, so your lobby can have 4 groups of 4. You can also join quests from outside a link party by talking to Alma, so you can do quests with anyone else in the lobby, its just less convenient. You can have a link party between players in different lobbies and a lobby with no link parties, but you probably want both.lastly, I personally found the music to be a little underwhelming compared to previous entries.None of the negatives are severe enough to be a deal breaker to me, especially since most of them will (hopefully) be patched out.EDIT:After thinking about it a while last night, I realized that what really sets the old world games (everything before Monster hunter world) apart from the more recent ones is the feeling that you are really in an intense fight with a monster. I cant really put my finger on what makes that difference, but it has something to do with the players ability to move more freely in current games.  Old world games required a lot more intentionality and commitment to attacks because a poorly timed or spaced attack could cost a cart. I feel like I can get through basically any hunt in Wilds by mashing buttons on my controller while wielding a sword and shield, but I do look WAY cooler doing it in wilds than in any other game.Part of what I enjoy about monster hunter is the community aspect. Joining a random quest to get materials you need and finding people spamming stickers and gestures and having fun in post game is as relevant as the combat itself to me. Those kinds of interactions aren't as accessible in old world games as they used to be (albiet not impossible to find).I'm playing with 2 different groups of friends so I am having fun helping them progress through the game while using my own time to do fashion hunting and grind materials for melding armor spheres and artian upgrades. Capcom added event quests and more weekly challenges today. Even if I don't enjoy this game the same way I did old world games, I am still having a lot of fun playing it and it still feels like there is enough for me to do (although I wish there was more).While it doesn't impact my review of this game at all, I would encourage anyone that enjoys wilds as their first monster hunter to play an old world game like Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate.Update as of HR100/~60 hours in game:I was at steam review character limit so I put it on reddit:https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1j7acuo/",positive
Monster Hunter Wilds,"Guys, I like the gameplay and all, but could you add more menus to the game? I feel like there are not enough menus in the game. I would like at least 2x more menus for each interaction. Also, I think 2-3 types of party aren't enough to play with a friend. We need at least 5-6 types. Maybe with 2-3 menus each.Also, could you add 2-3 submenus in the main-menu?",positive
Monster Hunter Wilds,"Incredible Game. After 60 and just hitting HR 100 I can say that - while I think the basegame DOES lack a bit of content compared to the release of the other Titles I played:- Investigations are insanely fun- Farming for Items be it Armor or Decos is incredibly fun and feels like a rewarding loop that didnt get stale for me so far- Outside of 2 Figths every Monster in this Game on release for me is a good and fun one.THE PC PORT HOWEVER LEAVES A LOT TO BE DESIRED. Lots of graphical issues and the game crashes for me at least like once a day.To however complains about the difficulty: Yes the Game isnt that hard, but its fights are fun and imo thats what matters way more",positive
Monster Hunter Wilds,"Ok, I'll say this Capcom. I love your games, I even loved this game so far, it has a lot of incredible stuff in it. I can see why people are giving it 8/10, 9/10, even 10/10. I'm even able to play it at a comfortable stable framerate with good visuals, because thankfully I'm blessed with quite a decent setup. But WHAT THE HELL is this lack of optimization and you trying to force Framegen on us? Not everyone is even able to use this tech. I saw how the game runs and looks on consoles, also not the best situation there.You'd think that the whole situation with Dragon's Dogma 2 would change smth for the better, and instead we have this.As of now, unless you have a beefy PC or an absolute MH fan, who'd play this game at a low locked framerate with possible sacrifices in terms of visuals, do NOT buy this game. Wait for a sale, better optimization, or whenever you have an amazing rig. This is the worst AAA product in terms of it's technical state that I've seen in a LONG time man.",negative
Monster Hunter Wilds,This game is everything wrong with PC optimization in 2025,negative
Monster Hunter Wilds,I paid 70 dollars to boot a crash report.,negative
Monster Hunter Wilds,My air fryer is more optimized than this,negative
Monster Hunter Wilds,Good gameplayBut poor optimizeMakes the game less fun,negative
Monster Hunter Wilds,Capcom please. auto collect the bug reports that you spent over 5 minutes generating. I beg of thy. manually emailing off bug reports is ancient tech.Looks like the game is getting confused when its forcing full screen on wide screen monitors. the crash report kicks up upon going full screen and then the game starts loading. Unfortunately the game thinks it crashed and after the crash tool has collected its log the game closes itself even though it is now loading. Hopefully changing out of full screen fixes this.,negative
Monster Hunter Wilds,"This game is absolutely amazing - but has the worst optimisation I've ever seen.I understand that new games are becoming more demanding and people are expected to upgrade, but this is absurd. I'm aware this isn't the first instance of new games having poor performance on launch, because the same thing happened with World, but it feels inexcusable at this point.I am by no means saying the game is bad, but in its current state, you should probably consider waiting for a more stable release.",negative
Monster Hunter Wilds,"Cramming whole story into low ranks was correct decision - making storyline more coherent and enjoyable.Gameplay wise - yup, they nailed it - boss attacks have such incredible feedback, and improvements to all weapons are significant enough to give them a fresh feel. This is the best Monster Hunter combat so far.On to high ranks!",positive
Monster Hunter Wilds,"Excited to play this game, but the poor performance has left me very disappointed.You compare this game with Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, which released earlier in the month, and it leaves me feeling that this level of performance for a big release from a big company like Capcom is simply not acceptable.I will update this review when Capcom has addressed and corrected the performance.",negative
Monster Hunter Wilds,"To frame my review a bit - I am a Monster Hunter vet all the way back to Freedom Unite. I've played Portable 3rd, 4U, Generations (and Ultimate), World (and Iceborne) and Rise (along with Sunbreak).I have a decent PC from 2 years ago though it is by no means a NASA simulation computer. I can run Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 on Ultra averaging 60 fps without DLSS frame gen. I do just fine at High settings with DLSS getting me to a crisp 120 fps average.Why can't I do the same thing with a game that released within weeks of each other even on Medium preset? DLSS has it's place but optimisation it DOES NOT replace.I will change my review when the game gets actual optimisation and not just duct tape (frame gen) to keep the performance ""acceptable"" at best.I see you, my fellow fans, with your Haha and Jester awards slung on bad reviews. I understand it hurts to see our beloved series being badmouthed but please hear us out. The criticisms are genuine but we all want a good game, I swear to you.EDIT 2: Very well. You win. You all wanted my specs, here you go:CPU: Core i7-11700kRAM: 32GBGPU: RTX 3070STORAGE: Corsair NVME SSDAre my parts 5 years old? Yes.Should it be able to run a new game just fine? Absolutely yes.Especially when it runs other new games very well.Baldur's Gate 3, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II. Space Marine 2, Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty, Dying Light 2, Helldivers II, Satisfactory, etc.",negative
Monster Hunter Wilds,"Ignoring the glaring performance and networking issues, I don't understand how you managed to make the multiplayer so bad after publishing Rise.When the multiplayer works, it has the same problems as World, like needing to start quests solo, find the objective, watch a cutscene, exit the quest, and join a friend to actually play the game together.Why? You already had a good system in Rise. If you're going to do sequences and cutscenes, let me at least bring a friend along.Also, link groups are a stupid mechanic. Why is progression not tied to the lobby?For the brief minutes where I do manage to fight the monster with friends, it's a really fun experience. This game may very well have the best combat in the series. I genuinely don't know why you designed the multiplayer this way.Edit: A lot of you mentioned playing from a squad lobby, and it did make joining after the cutscene much more bearable, but I still don't like the game's singleplayer oriented design for the story quests, especially when Rise and GU story quests both work flawlessly with multiplayer. (Haven't played the older games yet)Happy to report that non-story missions work with multiplayer almost flawlessly in Wilds. I'm hoping once my group reaches high-rank things will open up a bit more.",negative
Monster Hunter Wilds,How does a game manage to run perfectly fine in the Open Beta AND I receive an Excellent rating score on the benchmark but the actual product that costs ACTUAL MONEY runs like absolute sludge. I have legit never encountered a game that wasn't at worst playable. I have never seen a game run this poorly while still looking this bad.,negative
Monster Hunter Wilds,"Horribly un-optimized, un-intuitive menu system, 3 different friends lists, playing with friends is a pain in the ass you start a mission you get to the monster then wait then your party leader gets to the monster (in their own instance) then you accept their invite you get teleported BACK TO TOWN and have to run alllllll the way back to where the monster is",negative
Monster Hunter Wilds,"When the game lets me play it, it is very fun. I love the combat, the weapons feel smooth, the combos are expanded and for the most part is a very enjoyable experience.But...These auto walking sections are horrendous.Monster Hunter as a series has never been known for having a good story, and this is not a good story, let me hunt monsters and explore areas at my own leisure.The slow auto walking on the mount where you have no control, or the escort moments where you get forced to turn around if you move more than 2 inches in the wrong direction to go check out something cool are genuinely frustrating experiences.",positive
Monster Hunter Wilds,"Thank you Denuvo for locking me out of my own game trying to troubleshoot its poor launch optimization and play it on the one computer i own. I appreciate it! Capcom you really showed those dirty repackers and pirates a lesson by locking me out of the game I paid you close to one hundred American dollars for. You really saved me there--I don't know what i would do if were able to play with my friends for the one game we have all been excited about for half a year. You know what? You're right I don't need friends anyway. Hopefully they will all get locked out too. Then i can have friends again and we can talk about how slow the paint is drying on the walls of our homes because none of us can play the game we paid you, Capcom, close to one hundred American dollars for. So thank you Capcom and Denuvo, I appreciate it!",negative
Monster Hunter Wilds,"I absolutely love this game, however... In the technical state that it is in, I simply cannot recommend it. Capcom needs to stop releasing their games in such a sorry state. I will edit my review once this is fixed, but right now - it's an absolute mess:- 1 in 3 times, departing on a quest will crash the game after the loading screen.- Frame Generation is broken. It was fine in the 1st beta, but since the 2nd beta it has been causing crashes, freezes and insane FPS drops for me.- Without the frame generation, the game runs quite poorly on RTX 4070Ti. The optimization is absolutely horrible.- Enabling highest resolution textures causes constant pop-in, despite GPU having more than enough memory to store textures. What's the point in offering ab optional high-quality texture pack as a DLC if texture streaming is so broken?I'm sorry, but I am done giving publishers a pass simply because I like their games. In a full-price title Capcom nickel-and-dimes their players for the basic functionality like editing character appearance, yet they can't be bothered to make sure their game actually works properly.Get your stuff together, Capcom.",negative
Monster Hunter Wilds,"I think Capcom needs to learn how to optimize their engine instead of relying on Frame Gen as a crutch. There are a lot of people playing on PC, and I mean, a lot. At launch, 1.3 million players were playing this game simultaneously.Monster Hunter Wilds is actually a great entry in the series as of right now (before Title Update 1). But if you're wondering what PC game has the worst performance while still looking really bad, look no further than this.",positive
Monster Hunter Wilds,"Here's the most relevant reasons the game feels so bad until high-rank:1. Performance, and fidelity.Reasonable framerates on everything but the latest GPUs come at the cost of textures that look straight out of a ps2 game half the time. Why do my scoutflies look like minecraft particle effects when I'm not 2 inches from them? Why does having more than 2 entities on screen, or rotating my camera at all, cause stuttering? The difference in quality between this and other recent AAA titles is staggering. Wilds has such good designs and animations, which get severely neutered by the absolutely broken performance.2. Multiplayer cohesion.It is miserable to have to re-join a quest, only after someone has actively started the hunting portion of the quest, when you have played along the exact same questline. Not only that, even if you're playing in tandem, you have to ACTIVELY run away from the hunt you're trying to complete together in order to even re-join your friends, since the game gives you a connection error if you get hit by the monster you were immediately forced to fight. It's crazy that they managed to un-fix a problem I thought they'd resolved in other titles.3. Pacing.Good lord, it's miserable. Are you going to get a cutscene that forces you to leave the area immediately after a quest? Or maybe a dialogue sequence you have to skip through one message at a time? Or an unskippable auto-walk at the slowest possible movement rate on your seikret? After 2-4 of these, randomly chosen, you will be immediately thrust into a hunt that lasts all of 5 minutes. Repeat until the credits roll.4.  Difficulty.Worlds and Rise both had significantly harder monsters than anything in Wilds. They have tiny health pools that make it so you barely engage a monster before it's dead. Their attacks do negligable damage that is healed with 1 potion (or better yet by your palico which you no longer have any choices to make regarding their tools), and there's no threatening follow-ups to the monster attacks on the off-chance they even get you low enough to care. Wounds spawn constantly, and borderline stunlock monsters when you proc them. I never, ever felt anything that could qualify as a challenge, not even on the final boss, and so I felt like I had to rush the game to even have a chance at enjoying any gameplay, because HOPEFULLY high-rank is a little less trivial.5. Exploration.There is literally no reason to do any exploring, at all, ever. The closest you could get to an incentive would be for pop-up camp locations. Your seikret transports you to all but two destinations automatically, and the entire map and all of it's resources are revealed. There's no gameplay-driven reason to hunt for anything, and it is so sad because the artists put tremendous work into the scope and detail of the world, and the monsters, and the environments, and it all gets wasted because you're never made to gather monster tracks, or do an expedition, or hunt for gathering spots.When you combine all of these factors, you get a game that feels like it's trying to say""Hey, actually, please don't engage with me until the postgame, because every single system I'm built on is working together to make the process of getting there nothing but a chore.""It's insane how many systems they discarded that validated the entire experience of Monster Hunter. God, I hope high-rank has some challenge to it at least. It's unforgiveable how badly they designed this game in totality. Bless the artists, and the combat designers, but every director in charge of the rest of the game should be ashamed of the experience they've provided us.",negative
Monster Hunter Wilds,"Extremely fun gameplay but cant recommend in its current state.Exploding polygons/vertices, horrible texture pop-ins, network errors galore. Generally horrid optimization.Will change review once Capcom (hopefully) fixes these issues.",negative

Monster Hunter Wilds,"Welcome to gaming in 2025. Horrendous performance for rEaLiStIc GrApHicS, LIKE DAMN. I may own a powerhouse of a PC, but I prefer FPS over ""visual fidelity"", and this is horrendous.For me, the difference between ULTRA Native and bottom low settings is a 10 fps gap AT MOST.

This should be seamless this day and age.Also, you probably should have hashed out the performance and game-breaking bugs before releasing a full priced game.",negative
Monster Hunter Wilds,"Will change my review if things happen later.#1 - Frame Generation causes the game to instantly crash in most cases.#2 - Character Vouchers are stupid.  You've already bought the game, you should be able to change your character and Palico freely; the fact that they are charging for that is completely stupid.#3 - The game should be fine for most mid-range/lower end PCs WITHOUT having to enable Frame Gen.  So far, this has been a bad experience starting off, only made better by playing with friends.",negative
Monster Hunter Wilds,"Absolutely atrocious performance for how the game looks. Runs even worse than the beta. For reference, I could run the beta at a comfortable 60-70 FPS on High, usually higher than that. Now I'm running at less than 50 on Medium with noticeable dips. The game does not look nearly good enough to warrant this performance. Everything is covered in a grimy texture with assets that look like you straight took them out of a PS3 game. If I can run KCD2 and Cyberpunk on maxed out settings comfortably, then there is no reason this game should be running like this. Embarrassing. Wait for a sale and/or optimization updates. I've played games on my Deck that look better than this. When I was kid I couldn't believe how good MHFU looked on my PSP, an entire world in my hands. And now they release a game like this. It saddens me the mediocrity that Capcom has fallen into. But what do I know, maybe I'm just a little silly billy and my 4070 toaster is just outdated at this point. Guess I'll go back to playing better looking games on ultra.",negative
Monster Hunter Wilds,"PrefaceEver since our beloved series reached the eyes and ears of rest of the world, Capcom has made a valiant effort to keep Monster Hunter titles in check with various innovations to keep the series fresh and appealing to a wider audience. Remember the days when Gamespot gave Freedom Unite 5/10 for not having lock-on? Pepperidge farm remembers.In this regard, MHWilds has, for better or worse, been dumbed down so hunters - veterans and newcomers alike - can have a stress-free experience to explore, hunt, and craft as we have all done before. Overall, the changes are welcome additions that make Wilds a unique experience in its own right, but as I assume most other veterans of the series probably do already, I also have a list of complaints to address. These issues are what compels me to still recommend MHW/Iceborne as the definitive MH experience over Wilds (at least for the time being). And sorry, but I'm not even looking at you this time, Rise. You're third place no matter what.PositivesCore GameplayThe core gameplay always centered around the plethora of weapon styles and their mechanics. From Greatsword to Longsword, SnS to Dual Blades, Hammer to Hunting Horn, LBG to HBG, the choices are there for you to pick up and eventually master depending on how much time and effort you invest into each of them. Wilds added many new convenient features to each weapon; in my personal experience, I've been enjoying Charge Blade more than I ever have and it has replaced Longsword as my main weapon since the days of MHW/I. This time around, the game also allows you to swap weapons on the fly to a secondary while mounting your Seikret, a feature that seems less impactful than originally intended, but a convenient feature nonetheless, especially for those who are lazy to go into their tents every half hour. The exploration, gear/build crafting, fashion hunting: it's all there. More of the same old same old, depending on how you look at it. And we're all here for it.Multiplayer & QuestingThe lobbies and matchmaking in MHW/I were flawless in the first place. It wasn't hard to join up with friends in the same lobby, queue up for a quest, and hunt together. I've seen opinions about Capcom dropping the ball and making matchmaking worse somehow in Wilds, but I don't see it. The easy of access is still there, just not at first glance. The tradeoff, from what I can tell, is that they wanted us to always be roaming, always be seeing monsters everywhere we go without having to ""load in"" to an instance all the time. The quest queueing is still there, but the innovative option is easy to miss and give credit to. In terms of exploration, the only loading we have to go through is when we switch maps or queue into a quest (same as before), but we now also have the added feature of stepping out into a vast field of monsters right outside our doorstep. All in all, the tradeoff was worth it; wherever I am, I can step out onto an area of that map either on feet or on my Seikret and see a monster walking around - and I can hit. Beautiful, if you ask me. Almost - just almost - on par with Elden Ring levels of ""not taking us out of the immersion.""The MonstersThe bread and butter in some aspects of what defines a game in the series. Some may argue the monsters in Wilds aren't as appealing as they could be, but the amount of effort put into their designs and fight patterns is admirable. They don't seem as copy and pasty as I feared they would be, and we see many returning faces as well as newcomers. None of the patterns for the launch monsters seem broken or out of the ordinary either. Obviously, the community is looking forward to many more being added to the roster with updates, but the initial roster seems solid enough to keep us entertained. My only minor gripe is that some monsters lack an ""identity"" of their own, a factor which contributes to hunts feeling repetitive at times.NegativesRepetitive Flow - For the first time everAlthough the weapons feature numerous ""gimmicks"" and combos, along with unique focus attacks that provide a dopamine hit equivalent to successfully honing a weapon in Lost Ark (Dual Blades, thank you for letting me fly around like Levi, literally), this is the first MH title wherein I felt the combat became actually repetitive. The longer a hunt got, the more I found myself just wailing at a monster until it tired or fell. Don't get me wrong, this feeling exists in every MH game, but it has never been more prominent than it has in Wilds. This is the primary reason I consider MHW/I to be the stronger contender for being the definitive MH experience over Wilds; in Wilds, most - if not all - hunts end up becoming a gruelfest where I hope the quest just ends soon. And what's with all the monsters running away so many times? Arkveld runs away five or six times just because it runs out of breath or had its feelings hurt...Items and Builds - Unnecessary?I have a confession. I have not once used a Demondrug or Armordrug yet, and I'm almost done with the core game. I also have not eaten a meal before every quest. Is the game designed so hunts can be just as quick without proper preparation? I honestly miss the days when I would have the step-by-step process so engulfed into my brain as second nature: tent -> pick build loadout -> pick item loadout/restock -> eat at canteen -> load into hunt -> pop demondrug/armordrug/seeds -> choose pod -> jump down into Nergigante in Origin Isle -> rinse and repeat. These were staples in previous titles, so what happened? Slotting in decorations and optimizing builds seem fun at first, but I don't really see them contributing to cutting down my hunt times as much as they used to. Maybe this will change once elder dragons come into the picture.Lack of Central HubThe number of times I had to google the location of a NPC I was already familiar with is proof that we need a gathering hub with all the NPCs lined up with their names and job description highlighted above their heads. That is all. Looking forward to it in the next free title update, Capcom!Bland StoryIf I don't mention this category, I'm afraid I'll be misunderstood as having liked the story. No. Not at all. However, I do acknowledge that I was never a Monster Hunter fan for their storytelling or quality cutscenes showing me how many lives I changed by hunting down monsters. That being said, the only parts I enjoyed about the story in MHWilds is whenever Alma gave me authorization to hunt a monster and I would respond with ""Acknowledged"" and walked like the baddest mf on the planet. That was... cool.ConclusionFinal Verdict: 8/10 BAlthough the core gameplay is there and the game is solid so far, MHWilds isn't a game I would recommend over MHW/I in its current state.

The $70 starting price point is also no laughing matter, so newcomers should avoid falling into the ""gotta play the new game"" trap and tackle MHW/I first if you haven't tried it yet.Better yet, when you do come to Wilds one day, the game will more than likely have all the future updates available at your whim. The only thing potentially missing will be the influx of players to hunt with, but we all know there will always be hunters at your disposal.

Monster Hunter Wilds,"PrefaceEver since our beloved series reached the eyes and ears of rest of the world, Capcom has made a valiant effort to keep Monster Hunter titles in check with various innovations to keep the series fresh and appealing to a wider audience. Remember the days when Gamespot gave Freedom Unite 5/10 for not having lock-on? Pepperidge farm remembers.In this regard, MHWilds has, for better or worse, been dumbed down so hunters - veterans and newcomers alike - can have a stress-free experience to explore, hunt, and craft as we have all done before. Overall, the changes are welcome additions that make Wilds a unique experience in its own right, but as I assume most other veterans of the series probably do already, I also have a list of complaints to address. These issues are what compels me to still recommend MHW/Iceborne as the definitive MH experience over Wilds (at least for the time being). And sorry, but I'm not even looking at you this time, Rise. You're third place no matter what.PositivesCore GameplayThe core gameplay always centered around the plethora of weapon styles and their mechanics. From Greatsword to Longsword, SnS to Dual Blades, Hammer to Hunting Horn, LBG to HBG, the choices are there for you to pick up and eventually master depending on how much time and effort you invest into each of them. Wilds added many new convenient features to each weapon; in my personal experience, I've been enjoying Charge Blade more than I ever have and it has replaced Longsword as my main weapon since the days of MHW/I. This time around, the game also allows you to swap weapons on the fly to a secondary while mounting your Seikret, a feature that seems less impactful than originally intended, but a convenient feature nonetheless, especially for those who are lazy to go into their tents every half hour. The exploration, gear/build crafting, fashion hunting: it's all there. More of the same old same old, depending on how you look at it. And we're all here for it.Multiplayer & QuestingThe lobbies and matchmaking in MHW/I were flawless in the first place. It wasn't hard to join up with friends in the same lobby, queue up for a quest, and hunt together. I've seen opinions about Capcom dropping the ball and making matchmaking worse somehow in Wilds, but I don't see it. The easy of access is still there, just not at first glance. The tradeoff, from what I can tell, is that they wanted us to always be roaming, always be seeing monsters everywhere we go without having to ""load in"" to an instance all the time. The quest queueing is still there, but the innovative option is easy to miss and give credit to. In terms of exploration, the only loading we have to go through is when we switch maps or queue into a quest (same as before), but we now also have the added feature of stepping out into a vast field of monsters right outside our doorstep. All in all, the tradeoff was worth it; wherever I am, I can step out onto an area of that map either on feet or on my Seikret and see a monster walking around - and I can hit. Beautiful, if you ask me. Almost - just almost - on par with Elden Ring levels of ""not taking us out of the immersion.""The MonstersThe bread and butter in some aspects of what defines a game in the series. Some may argue the monsters in Wilds aren't as appealing as they could be, but the amount of effort put into their designs and fight patterns is admirable. They don't seem as copy and pasty as I feared they would be, and we see many returning faces as well as newcomers. None of the patterns for the launch monsters seem broken or out of the ordinary either. Obviously, the community is looking forward to many more being added to the roster with updates, but the initial roster seems solid enough to keep us entertained. My only minor gripe is that some monsters lack an ""identity"" of their own, a factor which contributes to hunts feeling repetitive at times.NegativesRepetitive Flow - For the first time everAlthough the weapons feature numerous ""gimmicks"" and combos, along with unique focus attacks that provide a dopamine hit equivalent to successfully honing a weapon in Lost Ark (Dual Blades, thank you for letting me fly around like Levi, literally), this is the first MH title wherein I felt the combat became actually repetitive. The longer a hunt got, the more I found myself just wailing at a monster until it tired or fell. Don't get me wrong, this feeling exists in every MH game, but it has never been more prominent than it has in Wilds. This is the primary reason I consider MHW/I to be the stronger contender for being the definitive MH experience over Wilds; in Wilds, most - if not all - hunts end up becoming a gruelfest where I hope the quest just ends soon. And what's with all the monsters running away so many times? Arkveld runs away five or six times just because it runs out of breath or had its feelings hurt...Items and Builds - Unnecessary?I have a confession. I have not once used a Demondrug or Armordrug yet, and I'm almost done with the core game. I also have not eaten a meal before every quest. Is the game designed so hunts can be just as quick without proper preparation? I honestly miss the days when I would have the step-by-step process so engulfed into my brain as second nature: tent -> pick build loadout -> pick item loadout/restock -> eat at canteen -> load into hunt -> pop demondrug/armordrug/seeds -> choose pod -> jump down into Nergigante in Origin Isle -> rinse and repeat. These were staples in previous titles, so what happened? Slotting in decorations and optimizing builds seem fun at first, but I don't really see them contributing to cutting down my hunt times as much as they used to. Maybe this will change once elder dragons come into the picture.Lack of Central HubThe number of times I had to google the location of a NPC I was already familiar with is proof that we need a gathering hub with all the NPCs lined up with their names and job description highlighted above their heads. That is all. Looking forward to it in the next free title update, Capcom!Bland StoryIf I don't mention this category, I'm afraid I'll be misunderstood as having liked the story. No. Not at all. However, I do acknowledge that I was never a Monster Hunter fan for their storytelling or quality cutscenes showing me how many lives I changed by hunting down monsters. That being said, the only parts I enjoyed about the story in MHWilds is whenever Alma gave me authorization to hunt a monster and I would respond with ""Acknowledged"" and walked like the baddest mf on the planet. That was... cool.ConclusionFinal Verdict: 8/10 BAlthough the core gameplay is there and the game is solid so far, MHWilds isn't a game I would recommend over MHW/I in its current state. As I mentioned in the preface, Wilds is more of the same in this humble veteran's eyes, and you can sit comfortably in front of your screen and take heart in knowing that even if you don't buy it now, the game isn't going anywhere. The $70 starting price point is also no laughing matter, so newcomers should avoid falling into the ""gotta play the new game"" trap and tackle MHW/I first if you haven't tried it yet.Better yet, when you do come to Wilds one day, the game will more than likely have all the future updates available at your whim. The only thing potentially missing will be the influx of players to hunt with, but we all know there will always be hunters at your disposal.

Monster Hunter Wilds,Imagine making a functioning game in 2025. Crazy right,negative
Monster Hunter Wilds,"Fix the performance issues. No excuse for this unfinished mess on release, especially if your charging $70 for it. My machine is 4 times what a PS5 is and a PS5 at least runs it consistently.",negative
Monster Hunter Wilds,"I love Monster Hunter. I have 3000+ hours across the recent titles. I played World/Iceborne on Playstation and then PC over again when the PC versions launched. I did the same for Rise/Sunbreak.I want to preface that I've finished the main story & beaten every monster the game has to offer.This game, wholeheartedly, is a downgrade in almost every aspect when compared to the previous titles. It's ""OK"" - but there's a lot of things that are just... bad decisions. They'll sell ""fixes"" through an expansion, like they did with Rise, but it's still NOT GOOD in the current state.We lost SO many quality of life changes.---------------------------------Graphical downgrade and terrible optimization. The game looks brown. Everything looks brown. There's filters/settings enabled that just makes it look *bad* - Sometimes, like in the lush forest, it looks incredible when the fog is off... but everywhere else it looks washed out. The FPS is awful (There's a typo in the config file you can fix to add a little more) and you will struggle to get over 60 FPS on average/decent computers.No idea what happened in testing.---------------------------------Multiplayer is terribly implemented. There's lobbies, link parties, environment links, and a billion other things you need to juggle just to play with people. We seriously went from >make lobby >join lobby >post quests and play... to whatever this is. Even if you're IN THE ENVIRONMENT LINK WITH FRIENDS you still get disconnected sometimes after defeating a single monster. It makes no sense.You're forced into 'cutscene gates' where you can't do things with people until you see certain things.. something that was FIXED in World because it was SO HATED AND ANNOYING. It's back! Playing with friends is ROUGH until you're at the end of the game.---------------------------------The game is incredibly theme-parky and ACTIVELY DISCOURAGES exploration. You are tethered to certain areas while doing any story mode missions. World encouraged vertical exploration and players to go around on their own, but on here everything is listed, shown, and auto-pathed to by your mount.There is no central hub, so it feels like you're constantly jumping around ""exhibits"" to find NPC's, quests, turn things in, and do whatever. It's very broken up, sparse, and feels incredibly clunky and jarring to navigate compared to the previous two titles (and even older ones). I guess they're adding a central hub eventually but didn't have enough time? Sucks.It feels like they took Frontiers and mutilated it, trying to have an ""MMO FEEL"" without any MMO mechanics. I cannot tell you the number of times I've had to look everywhere to find where to turn in quests.Even things like MAP MARKERS for camps are buried by other markers IN CAMPS and they're really difficult to see/fast travel to. The way the list of camps were shown in World made it *brain dead easy* to find... How did we go to this?---------------------------------The story is very bland. I'd even say that it's awful. I won't go into spoilers or specifics, but there's absolutely no ""big catastrophe"" you're trying to avert or anything major that's being built up to.Most of the dialogue is patronizing, condescending, or very ""life is special"" - and it just rings really hokey. There's also not even a dragonator anywhere in the entire game. I'd put it on the same level as ""base"" Rise's story, which says a lot.There's very few memorable characters, moments, or anything along those lines. Part of what makes some of the story of the previous titles so good is how extra and over the top some of the characters are. Again, no dragonator moments.It can also be completed in less than 10 hours without rushing. It just kinda.. ends.---------------------------------The experience feels soulless. I dunno how else to put it other than feeling like nothing is inspired, and more like everything was ""lets do this again"" in Wilds. It feels like there was no vision beyond ""Make another World game"" and Capcom executives yelling at the developers to do so. The phrase I've heard a LOT of friends using (who are veterans of MH far longer than I am, since the original) is that it feels *incredibly* corporate.You kinda just get it as a vibe. As you play through, the longer you play through, you'll understand what I mean.---------------------------------Monster variety is very limited, and there's nothing really ""stand out"". Even the flagship monster is uninspired compared to previous title flagship monsters. Going through the entire game, killing every single monster available, I cannot think of a single one that impressed me or made me go ""woah"" on the same level of things like Vaal Hazak, Velkhana, Malzeno, Xeno'Jiiva, etc had to offer. It feels like you're fighting three archetypes the entire game.A lot of monsters are repeats from previous games, including the movesets and skeletons (which have been used on a few of the new ones), which is a bit disappointing considering how few actually exist.I'm actually worried about future content because most of the announced monsters are just filler/mid tier monsters... and the game's already done. The escalation wont be there unless they add things like Alatreon, etc, alongside smaller threats.---------------------------------There's no endgame. You farm two or three tempered monsters at the end and that's it. There's no carrot on a stick to pursue and you'll be done as a dedicated player within a few days.  I won't go into extreme detail but yeah, nada.---------------------------------Decorations are really weird now. Most attack based ones can only be put on weapons (Such as ballistics, etc), which means only 3 slot weapons can fit them. Three slot slots on armor/etc CANNOT wear the same decorations as weapons. This severely limits builds. Most armor sets also are just *incredibly* lackluster when it comes to skills provided.I get this limits player power but.. it just feels really clunky on how they did it.---------------------------------The entire new wound system is just clutch claw from Iceborne but way more auto-pilot. You do huge amounts of damage while wounding, get free materials, and CONSTANTLY KNOCK DOWN MONSTERS from applying wounds. There's fights you're going to do later once you're geared where monsters cannot get up off of the ground.People complained about the clutch-claw gameplay and this is just the exact thing.. but WAY more  overtuned and broken. Even the hardest monsters the game has to offer kinda get destroyed by any sort of wound mechanic.---------------------------------The food system is a downgrade. I get what they were going for but in simplifying it they've made it kinda awful. Getting materials sucks, the stores that sell/offer ingredients only seem to give you rations, and the bonuses from food are lackluster. We went from having major defense up, attack up, ammo conservation, and all these other awesome things to just basic buffs.NOT TO MENTION THERE'S NO PALICO CUTSCENES FOR FOOD COOKING. RIP Grandma food cat.---------------------------------The camera is awful. Monsters are bigger than your screen and tracking is bad. Can't count the number of times later that bigger monsters are just 95% of your screen and you can't see what they're doing fast enough. Even at max zoom/focus it's a downgrade from World.---------------------------------I *want* this game to be better than it is and I know they'll make it better in the future, but man, I wouldn't be surprised if I see lots of people going back to play World/Iceborne after a couple of weeks of Wilds.Monster Hunter fans will still find enjoyment in the game but the entire way through you'll probably be thinking ""I miss this"" or ""This is clunky"" or ""This was done better"" - and that's just sad to me.",negative

Monster Hunter Wilds,It's great when it works.Too bad it barely works.,positive
Monster Hunter Wilds,"I do enjoy it but for a game that talks a lot about ""preparing well for the hunts"", there isn't any incentive to prepare for any of the hunts, you just smash the monster and go to the next without any real thinking.This game is piss-easy because it automates all the answers you need for every challenge you face and I don't like that personally and unfortunately I don't see the post launch content ever fixing that issue without reworking how the game works fundamentally, especially the Palico system. The preparation aspect of Monster Hunter games is completely dead here.Don't get me wrong, I'm all up for making the campaign easier and more accessible for newer players, steady income of newcomers is a sign of a healthy playerbase, hell if it wasn't for my friend I would drop MH:World after first 5h, but the aspect of this game solving all the problems for you doesn't go away even against the hardest of monsters currently the game has to offer which ultimately makes the encounters not as exciting as they should be.",positive
Monster Hunter Wilds,"The game is really good, but the performance is horrible for most people; a lot of it can be traced to bad I/O and streaming. Some of it can be attributed to the overly active anti-tamper; there's more FPS correlation when installing the game on a fast NVMe SSD than having a 500 vs 1000 dollar GPU, which is ridiculous.The game runs well on my machine but that's no excuse for how badly it runs on most machines, especially when this is a game that you play with friends.Avoid buying until you hear that Capcom has made the game actually run well on your machine; make sure to check with the benchmark before you buy. I won't be surprised if/when a crack comes out and the game runs way better with it.",negative
Monster Hunter Wilds,"OK so the performance is bad. I loved this game, continue to love this game, would recommend this game. It completely dismissed the worries I had after enjoying Rise so much that it'd have the same issues that World did.BUT I do have some thoughts. A lot of small problems that just make this game really frustrating. These are in no way deal breakers, and in fact half the reason they bother me so much is because I like the game, it's very good.Like first off, the story? Actually pretty good. I'm sure a lot of people probably skipped it and most people rushed it. The former's understandable, the latter feels almost intended for reasons I'll get to in a bit. Originally I was kind of annoyed because a sticking point I had with World was its emphasis on story, mainly because of how it portrayed it and how it was so intrusive. I figured, considering it was a big complaint for a lot of people, they would've cut down on it for this one. Instead they went the exact opposite direction and FOCUSED ON IT EVEN MORE. Now, again, I liked it, mostly because it had good pacing and the character dynamics were fun. It reminded me a lot of Monster Hunter 4's story, actually. There are some really good cutscenes and the ending bangs. Even if the dialogue can be pretty cheesily delivered (no shade to the VAs, they're excellent).My problem mostly came with the fact that the story progression and how the game is advertised kind of run in conflict with each other. This is only an open world Monster Hunter in the sense that loading screens aren't a thing when moving between most areas. If you try to explore this world, particularly early on, there are multiple times where you'll be stopped and railroaded into doing a story quest. For most of the game, there'll be no monsters outside of the ones you experience in the story, so the areas end up feeling barren. Even the systems that do exist when you venture outside without a quest are half-baked versions of what they become later. This is especially notable if you're playing with friends, because it can be kind of cumbersome to do the story together and assuming you haven't finished it and just want to play together, depending on where you are there might not be that much *to* do. Compare this to Rise or the classic monster hunters where when you get to a new rank usually you're just given a bunch of monsters to go hunt and it seems kind of odd given the open world is kinda the selling point of this game. You'd kinda expect that you could go out and fight a bunch of monsters rather than just being met with vegetation and the one or two you've unlocked. The story always auto running you to locations (especially ones you've already been through) and pulling control away don't exactly always make them an exciting proposition. Especially when you just wanna. Y'know. Hunt Monsters.Adding onto that, the UI in this game is. So bad. It's so bizarre, actually, because like...they had it figured out. Like, it was fine in Rise. Hell, I remember World's UI being better. But this game, I really don't know what happened. Visual clarity could be a loooot better, they've added menus menus and more menus, this game really loves its menus, the health bar is really small for some reason and the sharpness indicator doesn't have the same decrease feedback it did in previous games. Some things are just oddly presented in a way that feels like the developers thought it was obvious but I've seen enough people be totally stumped by to be pretty sure it isn't. I was actually so vocally frustrated during my time with this game, it's actually crazy that the UI is designed like this.Anyway, all of that sounds bad. And it is, I guess, but I feel like that's also maybe a testament to how good this game is. The story can be frustrating at times but the actual experience of it, despite the cons that come with it, was pretty nice and it doesn't outstay its welcome. You're always going to new places and meeting new people and monsters, and there are soooo many new monsters. And once it's done, the game ends up being exactly what you expected it to be. Exploring the world becomes fun and comfy and rewarding, so many quests pop up, etc. While I don't necessarily agree with this game taking the ""Low Rank is the tutorial"" idea to its logical extreme, I can at least say that what the game set out to deliver on it delivers on really well.Except the open world which isn't much of an open world. That's not a bad thing though, in fact I feel like this is the best case scenario for what this idea could have been. It feels very Monster Hunter.Also the fights in the story are reeeally fun. There were so many times where I was just saying ""THAT'S SO COOL"" while fighting, and I was actually kind of surprised at what they were willing to put in there in terms of difficulty. It's not hard, exactly, but it's more aggressive earlier than I'd expect (in a good way). Weapons are more versatile than they've ever been and even though seikrets can sometimes be a bit annoying to control (please for the love of god STOP MOVING), their functionality is really nice and they're set neatly apart from their predecessors, the palamutes. This game just adapts to the idea of being so on-the-go really well. Also it's really pretty, especially when the textures aren't taking forever to load in.I'm enjoying this game a lot, might honestly be among one of my favorites in the series (we'll give it some time). Yes, it has a lot of problems, technical or otherwise, but unless it just genuinely can't run on your computer then I wholeheartedly recommend this game. If you do, though, be sure to make your voice heard. Problems can't exactly be fixed if they don't know about them.",positive

Monster Hunter Wilds,"""Finished"" the main story, good game but they removed a lot of the things from Monster Hunter World that made me want to jump in an explore. The mounts automatically take you to the objective at a very fast pace so gone is learning an area and finding the shortcuts and interesting places, I assume this is because the areas are bigger and the hubs are connected to them but I feel this feature doesn't really add anything to the game. Difficulty is much lower also, few enemies up to this point have presented any challenge whereas the first time I took down an Anjanath in World was exhilarating. The overall effect of these changes is that I don't feel the drive to keep hunting for the fun of it and pushing through the story felt like a bit of a chore.",positive
Monster Hunter Wilds,"AMD BEWAREI generally dislike leaving negative reviews when a game just released because I'm afraid it'll seem like jumping on the ""hate the popular thing"" bandwagon etc.However.The perfomances are one thing I can ignore, it doesn't run good but it runs well enough on my machine, I can wait for updates for thatWhat I cannot ignore however is the inability of the game working on top of the line AMD GPUs, I have a 7900XT and the game crashed on startup, until I figured I had to turn on WINDOWS 7/8 COMPATIBILITY MODE IN THE EXECUTABLE PRORIETIESAnd that's where the huge problem lies, if you turn on Comp mode, half of the textures â¥â¥â¥â¥ themselves, I'm not talking about a lttle artifact here and there, I'm talking about a MASSIVE artifact covering the ENTIRE screen as soon as there's a rock in frame, this is unnacceptable especially for the flagship product of a companyAnd you cannot turn it off once you booted, you'd think maybe the issue was shaders compiling, or somethingBut no.Turning off comp mode brings the game back to crash on startupI still put up with it considering it's either that or no monstie at all, but the review is a solid negative and will stay as is until the problem get hotfixed.AMD BEWARE unless you're ready to have your eyes bleed.For now at least.Those armour sets are banging though.",negative
Monster Hunter Wilds,"Monster Hunter is my childhood series of nearly 16 years,Optimisations are not the sole issue.Performancehas beenunnecessarily poor for many people. However,fixing this will not solve the game's frustrating nature.Visual design is great. Combat has been truly impeccable. However, every other sect of direction has lain the devil in the details, creating a grossly obstructive and discouraging experience while taking multiple steps back from the whole series. It's clear the game is unfinished.As a whole package, when only one of the main components established over 20+ years is done well and worthwhile side content is summed up by 'the fishing's kinda cool now', there is a huge problem.So TL;DR: Roundabout and cluttered UI,a gutting of series mechanics without fun, appropriate replacementsand a story whose beats are brief and forgettable on purpose, yet is frustratingly paced, stretched and ground down rails like something worth telling - handholding far exceeding time actually spent hunting. Insult to injury comes from ignoring Rise for an obtuse multiplayer worse than World's painful 'leave and restart the quest to let friends join' system.All to imprison you in a title whose major innovation is finally being open world for 'player freedom'.So how does this begin to come together?On UI:Try adding a friend you already know through this game without joining the same lobby. There's no dedicated ""Friends"" menu. You will probably take 10 minutes. Wanna play together? Go to the same lobby. Now you need a link party. Now you need to...It isalla sub menu jungle: poorly planned, explained and labelled.More importantly, there's a HUD ripped from a 'corporate open world slop' mockup you'd find around Elden Ring's release. Most of it can be customised, but there's a beady, omnipresent and unremovable objective marker, duplicated on the un-customisable minimap telling you where everything is through visual barf; it all blends together.These features are notorious for stealing your attention from a game. Perhaps forgivable elsewhere, but 2 of Monster Hunter's core components are attacked by this. One by being cheaply replaced. It actuallystrips the series' special identity.What are they and why are they important then?1)Preparation.Straight forward step. Pick out your items and equipment. Eat. Head out. It's a light strategic phase relying on memory and your personal preference. Without it you make life 10x harder.2)Scouting and foraging.Huge part of what makes MH special. Exploration and becoming familiar with a location, its details and secrets were given similar importance to learning the behaviors and patterns of the monster you hunted because of how they - and you - are intertwined. Your understanding is personal and ropes you into feeling part of the world. Since environmental hazards came out, this saw explicit gameplay reward too.3)Tracking.Before World it was your way to secure your combat reward for good scouting, with light management because paintballs wore off. World made it an additional reason to engage with the environment; how well it was done is up to interpretation.4)Combat and chase.Self explanatory. The meat of the game and main reward for locating the target monster.You may notice these are simplified steps to actual hunting.So which of these are attacked exactly?Scouting:Immediately knowing where everything is defeats the need and incentive to explore. How the hell are we expected to care for cool spots we never discovered ourselves? Stray too far and the game yanks you away for daring to look at something new. Somehow they removed joy and wonder from higher tier environment design. At least they let us physically ignore 90% of the world by holding a button to laser focus on text in the most braindead iteration of gathering to ever grace us.Tracking:This is what's removed outright, replaced by the tacky magic objective marker. Tracks still exist but only give you currency. Scout flies became useless by World's endgame so that's why?Well there's a clear rework they could've done:Believe it or not sneak attacks and bushes exist as afterthoughts to some basic stealth system. If they wanted to remove tracking,why wasn't the level design built with engaging stalking in mind, where some monsters only stayed to fight or could lose their special power if we snuck up on them first?What if our ""intelligent"" seikret could be taught to help with this? Why didn't they replace scoutflies with the raptor following scents?Wanted to keep the flies and tracking anyway? Have them trained to only follow monsters tagged by paint for the whole hunt. Ruin hiding tactics or some amazing camouflage that's hard to see with the naked eye. It's reason to care about rain too.Right now, only having prep for battle sounds like a glorified boxing ring.""Monster Brawler"" is not the name of the series.Anything else of value?Each of these are so far absent:-Home customisation-Endemic life as pets-Mounts engaging in combat-Collectables-RaidsCooking skill variety is pretty sad compared to every other game too.MH games always offered 'extra'. (Raids would need improving)But the combat's still good, right? How does this affect me?Lazy choices disrespecting core identity lead to lazy choices disrespecting you and this is present throughout. Not just in boring navigation, backwards menus or some nightmare 4-5 steps with recursive loop to playing multiplayer with friends. So how does combat fare...?Low Rank is Hell.The mind-numbing kind.1)A top complaint is hunts being too short.The devs failed to develop a new, fun, gameplay buildup to engage with before fighting, nor have they balanced the combat to really let you partake in this part's stellar system. 5-10 minutes when hours deep is immensely dissatisfying. It's a potato chip experience: tastes great but is gone too soon. Rise and World got it just right.2)Build crafting.Decorations are segregated on whether they're a 'weapon gem' or 'armor gem', removing creative slot management and the satisfaction of optimal builds howyouwanted. Very old games would add to one skill and take from another. Balancing that prevented OP builds better than this restrictive, over-corrective mess.3)Then there's the story.World let you breathe - Wilds crushes your windpipe. Progression for ~75% of your first 8-16Hrs is stuck in the most shallow, uninspired nothingburger drivel, forcibly handholding you throughout it all. Some interesting lore and that's it. Frequent are shacklings to tiny spaces just in case you wanted to - God forbid - play the game. Combine howshortthe hunts are and the bore drills deep.So what's the recurring problem here?Everything is designed to stop you engaging with the game, both implicitly and explicitly. Going so far as to hollow the experience out and prescribe you a narrow vision on how to interact until finally opening up by endgame. Dozens of hours in.Unlike any other MonHun, you can't really look, learn or enjoy outside combat. Minimal side content. Constant nags on where to go, where to stand, who to speak to and when play's allowed between each. And every. Quest... Sounds like a school - that fun to you?And it's tragic because there are cool, fun little details with beauty to witness. Again, combat is fantastic. But for all these efforts to make the game worth playing, someone in Capcom's out of touch management either refused to let the game cook or stirred the pot, thinking MH as 'just another action game' when the legs are built on so much more.

Monster Hunter Wilds,Super unoptimised runs like â¥â¥â¥â¥. You shouldnt use the launch as an excuse to deliver an unoptimised game. This is whats wrong with the modern game industry.

Monster Hunter Wilds,"Let me add to the pile.Game is Monster Hunter. Can't argue with that and it plays like game from the series but..Having a NEW release looking worse than it's 2018 Worlds and not being able to run smoothly - developers deserve a long wooden log shoved right in their greedy arseholes. having 3080 with barely 60 fps in a desert landscape while Worlds offered so much in just first 5 minutes needing less and looking better says a lot of today's state of the industry. Dragon's Dogma incident repeated. You do not deserve the love from the MH community Capcom. You do not.After more hours i keep my review negative as people think it would change anything. No. Game looks like ass, runs like ass. Shimmer cause by dlss, frame generation on ground, can't run in native resolution without AI upscalers. Even medium preset decided for You that you are not playing native, no no. You gotta have performance FSR or DLSS and frame generation on.",negative
Monster Hunter Wilds,"BIG UPDATE:IT'S NOT WORTH THE PRICE: IT'S SHORT. IT'S REALLY SHORT (and easy)!I didn't expect that, but I beat the game having left it up for at least 5 hours, and 16 hours of those were low-rank/campaign cutscene heavy play, leaving around 19-20 hours of actual gear grinding and monster fighting, but with almost none of the decision making I would expect for the gear.It indeed is very easy too (just as others said it was); I've beaten every boss in the game and only maybe have a few tempered enemies less to beat, and I've carted/died maybe 3-4 times? There's not much reason to grind except to pass the time (which I probably will just to get the money's worth), as with a max tier hammer AND dual blades already equipped as of beating the final boss, I would just be grinding for random decorations and the goofy ""Artian""/ random weapon stat parts system for the hell of it - not because there's any actual progression left. Not like I just rushed either; this is just from playing to get the hunter rank to actually fight said final boss.I kind of blame this on them putting all defensive jewels on armor, and all offensive ones on weapons, thus leaving nothing left on the armor except stamina/defense/evade window (and maybe the set bonuses I don't have reason to get at this point)? They added weapon swapping, but didn't think through the effects of changing the gear systems so poorly to match.Even issues from the original review I made (that was under halfway through) still ring true:1:It's not well optimized. I'm not having issues, but just by looking at my own performance metrics (on a beefy computer) I can see how much it's using up for a game that really, really shouldn't be. It's no wonder many are having problems right now.2: The UI is awful for no reason. Tons of games have done the MMO styled inventory UI, maps, controls, etc. all better than MH has over the years.3: the game is terrible for co-op. You have to do some kind of wonky thing where you invite people to a ""link group"", and then to your environment in order to properly quest in the same party/town. It works story quests, but figuring it was is a nightmare, where you need everyone to go enter the quest and go through the cutscenes until it says ""quest started"" and then you need to actually join someone in your link group (abandon the quest) just to actually join them, but it does thankfully count for progress. Seriously clunky.4: A lot of moveset complexity is missing. No stance swapping or wirebugs from Rise (same with palico skill customization). The weapon swapping is indeed nice and allows for swapping up builds to strengthen the other (like poison application into a weapon swap while it's ticking away), but it's not quite the same thing if you are dedicated to a weapon I suppose, as all that second weapon lets you do then is swap an element and that's it. No extra capabilities or options to freshen up the fights, so every fight feels the same in terms of what moves you make.5: It's ""open world"", but the campaign is an awful, linear boredom fest with a giant pile of slow auto-walk sections (and I do mean it's actually automatically walking your forwards at a certain speed). Cutscenes I couldn't skip fast enough with character designs picked out of a roulette wheel. Plus, by the time you get to high rank and actually just get to go out and hunt.... if you fight the wrong/higher rank monsters lying out in your world, the game just tells you that ""you can't"" and if you kill them yoi get no quest reward. Why even spawn then in your co-op game if you and your friends can't be rewarded for that yet? Why make it open exploration at all? What does it do other than reduce performance. To make it EVEN worse, I'd argue that the map design is much less well designed and smaller than world for each area, much less vertically capable, and in general just not as good as either. Seems like they focused too much on interlinking everything than they did making it good, which reminds me of that DLC area from Rise that was trying to be everything, but ended up being a bit unrefined.6: The inventory management is awful. Constantly have to go to the camp box to store excess items, and the game expects you to get them, or else you won't be able to craft anything. No way to auto-send easily like in Rise it seems? It does get sent to your box if you are full on picking up something, but you have to awkwardly go through confirmation prompts and a menu that forcibly pops up every single time you grab something in that case (even when grabbing with the grappling hook), which is bad for the flow of the game.Compared to the other MH games I've played (World & Rise)? It's a fun game, but It's much less of an improvement than I'd hoped over World. In-fact, I dare say it's actually just a side grade.... or worse. Rise lost a lot of world design but gained a lot of mechanics development... but here, we got nothing really, and some things became less interesting overall. Even rise had many more monsters on release, and rise added a lot of new combat mechanics and features even if added less monsters. This was made in the same exact engine and clearly uses a lot of the same monster move-sets and everything (and doesn't even look great for the performance), so I'm surprised they don't just have more monsters from world in here to help improve the content limitations given they would just need a visual fix-up. I was expecting more with this being a major mainline entry and not the mobile console release rise was, but here we are.Everything is weaker; the roster, the weapon depth, the armor decisions to be made based on build... even the end grind isn't particularly exciting to think about with no real goals, or even cohesion; my game winning build is 5 evade window and some stamina/recovery up an any hammer/dual blades I feel like, and I just cobbled it together randomly as I played with no thought. The areas are less interesting, there's less depth to palicos/movesets/secret collection... in fact are there even any secrets to find like the little critters in Rise? The few secrets I found just had a lot of random collectable trade items in them, which are only for use in the overly simple cooking buffs (where there's also really no decisions to be made). Man, even the little cooking animations are worse; who just fries a whole quarter of a head of cabbage/lettuce like that and bites it off a knife?It isn't worth the price; fun, but on a sale (probably for around $30-40, not 70 or higher). If you are planning on playing it regardless of that (or from a later sale), make sure your computer can actually handle it, and for co-op... wait for some guides on how that even works (if at all for the story). A lot more of a mess than it should be right now.Hopefully some non-DLC updates add something, because I definitely struggle to recommend it if you are here for the gameplay with that practically ""Path of Exile"" level waste of a campaign dragging it down for the first half, and the lack of interesting design or even content in general or in the second half.",negative
Monster Hunter Wilds,"This might get drowned out by all the reviews about performance, but there are many issues I had with the game past that.Difficulty:I used pc controls and the lance for the first time for my playthrough and didn't even need to craft armor until Guardian Doshagama, going from 11 defense to 131. From there it was a cake walk just by using what random materials I had from doing quests, even beating a tempered Arkveld right after beating the main story with no problem still using random bs. I understand wanting to make a game accessible to all skill levels, but doing it to this degree gives most players no reason to interact with the open world at all during the story, and considering the lack of postgame, basically invalidates the open world as a whole.Weapon and combat changes:Counter reliance is bad for monster hunter, and every weapon has some form of counter in this game, with certain weapons revolving around spamming counters now. Plus, certain overtuned attacks have made some weapons lose nuance in gameplay, and in conjunction with wound attacks, makes the combat feel really spammy. Also, the combination of wounds, clashes, and offsets really thrashes the monsters around, making even returning threats feel more pathetic than ever. The majority of combat changes seem to prioritize making the game more cinematic and satisfying over giving it mechanical depth, which I can enjoy for one game, but I hope that design philosophy is a one time thing. [Additional minor nitpick: what kind of logic makes wounds go away when you hit them, and makes it so you can only do certain combos if you start them by hitting a wound?]Content and pacing:I beat every main quest, side quest, and monster available at launch in 27~ hours of gameplay, and I wasnât really in much of a rush. Whatâs arguably worse is that you pretty much fight the final boss in low rank, and the entirety of high rank feels like postgame, with its final fight being a rematch from low rank. Then, there is basically no actual post game other than fighting a handful of tempered monsters harder than what you get from doing the main high rank quests.Monsters:The new monsters are fine. Since it's a subjective topic, all I care to mention is that the movesets of some seem shallow, and many of their moves plus the new moves given to old monsters seem poor at indicating the direction and space theyâre gonna take up. I also think they lack the charm found in many classic monster hunter monsters, but that can be applied to monsters from rise and world as well.The environment:It's decent, which is devastating in comparison to how amazing the locales were in world. Not including graphical issues, it can be ugly and dark and boring at times, but can certainly be beautiful, especially in the ruins. However, the level of creativity pales in comparison to the fantastical coral highlands and rotten veil. Even the clever use of every single imaginable shape and form of ice in the hoarfrost impressed me more than anything shown in this game. Plus, the endemic life was kind of lame, with many of them being slightly altered, real world lizards. Also, having to catch something for a quest that I already caught previously was annoying.My general opinion:This game is deeply disappointing to me, not because it's objectively bad, but because I expected much more. It seems like they learned from the feedback given to world, but forgot a lot of what they did to make that game as good as it was in the first place. Also, as I was playing, many aspects of the game seemed like a collection of many good-but-underdeveloped ideas, lacking the depth and attention to detail I was looking forward to from this team. Aside from negative feelings, I was able to make a decent amount of fun of it, but cannot recommend buying this game before beating the majority of worldborne.",negative

Monster Hunter Wilds,"As of current time of writing this, I'm 81 hours into the game. I took my time playing this, without skipping any dialogue for both main story and optional missions.Monster Hunter: Wilds had a lot of issues for quite a lot of people, but my playthrough was completely fine and smooth. I just had to update my drivers and everything was perfect.Though I usually wouldn't focus on a Monster Hunter story, this one had me intrigued a little bit and kept me entertained throughout. The game really does open up once you finish the story though, so I can imagine a lot of other people rushing through it. Having the entire main story be put within low-rank was a good idea, as it's like the tutorial part of the game where you understand the mechanic of the monsters and how they work before going into high rank. You can also learn different weapon playstyle while going through the story.If you can get past all the optimisation issues, the gameplay is super fun and addicting, especially with all the different weapon playstyle. There's a playstyle for everyone in this game. A lot of improvements and new animations to every weapon from previous Monster Hunter games making gameplay feel fresh. The combat is as good as it gets for a Monster Hunter game.Playing with friends definitely make the whole experience better, though it isn't a must. There are support bots now when you send out SOS, and they can be quite OP. They're better than a big chunk of the player base in the game, and they can't die too which does in fact make the game too easy. Speaking of easy, this is definitely one of the easiest Monster Hunter games out there.As current time of this review, I'm currently HR69. Still got a lot more to explore, but so far everything's been great!",positive
Monster Hunter Wilds,"Just finished the first hunt and got to the base camp. I'm really enjoying myself. It feels really good, more fluid than world.In the benchmark and beta, my performance was tolerable, enough that I was worried. have a 7800xt and a 5700x3D. I'm running 1440p on ultra, AMDfsr 3 and frame gen are on, I'm sitting above 100FPS. So far aside from a couple hitches and stutters that I'm pretty sure are cache related, the game is running solid.HOWEVER, I KNOW that if I didn't have FSR3 and Frame Gen on, I would be struggling to get above 60FPS. These tools should be used so lower spec PCs can get in on the fun and instead they're flat out required to make the game run decently. Why do you think the game literally advises you to turn frame gen on?Some of the textures in this game look worse than even PS2 era and apparently the high res texture pack causes issues for people with very high specs. The game as a whole somehow looks worse yet better than World. It's bizarre.The game is demanding because it's poorly optimised. I have no idea why so many are blaming end users equipment - as if PC gamers forgot how to adjust graphics settings over night. Get your heads out of your ass.Dragon's Dogma 2 was a performance mess. So was Helldivers 2, which everyone seems to forget. Almost every major game release the last few years has had issues (Shout out Lies of P you were so good for that) but because MH is your favourite franchise and it runs fine for you, you blame others. Get your barroth sized heads out of your congalala sized ass.Anyway, I do believe Capcom will address the issues the game and won't leave it to die like they're doing with Dragon's Dogma 2.

Monster Hunter Wilds,"Monster Hunter Wilds is a great game ... just not yet and hopefuly with some updates my review might change.The GoodLetâs start with the positives. Visually, Wilds is stunning. Its environments are beautifully crafted, and the combat remains impeccable, carrying forward the deep, rewarding mechanics that define the series. The thrill of the hunt is still here, with weapons feeling satisfying to use and monsters providing exhilarating challenges.The fishing is also kinda cool now. (Yes, thatâs actually a highlight.)The IssuesHowever, despite its strengths, Wilds stumbles in nearly every other aspect. Performance has been unnecessarily poor for many players, and while optimizations will likely come in future patches, they wonât fix the gameâs more fundamental problems. Wilds takes multiple steps back from the series' core identity, creating an experience that is frustratingly obstructive and unfinished.UI and NavigationThe user interface is a mess. Something as simple as adding a friend without joining the same lobby is an ordeal. The gameâs multiplayer is somehow more obtuse than Worldâs already clunky system, requiring unnecessary steps just to play with friends.The HUD is cluttered with unnecessary markers and information overload, stealing attention from the world and combat. Instead of immersing players, it bombards them with visual noise that detracts from exploration.Loss of Core Monster Hunter IdentityMonster Hunter has always been about preparation, scouting, tracking, and finally engaging in combat. Wilds strips away these core gameplay elements in favor of shallow, modern open-world tropes.Scouting is undermined by objective markers that tell you exactly where everything is, removing the joy of discovery.Tracking is gone, replaced by an ever-present magic marker that directs you to your target without effort.Exploration is actively discouraged, as the game yanks you back if you stray too far.Combat, while still strong, is hindered by poor pacing and an overabundance of hand-holding.Rather than enhancing the experience, these changes reduce Monster Hunter to a streamlined action game, stripping away the depth that made past titles special.Low-Rank Experience and StoryEarly-game progression is a slog. Hunts are too short, often lasting only 5-10 minutes, making combat feel rushed rather than rewarding. Build crafting has been oversimplified with restrictive gem slotting, eliminating the creativity and satisfaction of optimizing a setup.The story, meanwhile, is both forgettable and frustratingly intrusive. Unlike World, which gave players room to breathe, Wilds constantly shackles players with excessive handholding, preventing them from engaging with the game on their own terms. The first 10 hours feel like a prolonged tutorial, suffocating any sense of freedom.Whatâs Missing?Many beloved features from past games are either absent or underwhelming:No home customizationNo endemic life as petsNo meaningful mounts in combatNo significant collectiblesNo raidsCooking lacks variety compared to previous titlesThese missing elements further dilute the experience, making the world feel emptier and less engaging.The VerdictMonster Hunter Wilds has immense potential. Its combat remains excellent, and its world is breathtaking. However, its misguided design choices, frustrating UI, lack of core Monster Hunter elements, and poor pacing make it a difficult game to recommend at launch. If Capcom can address these issues through updates and expansions, Wilds could eventually become a worthy successor to past titles.",negative
Monster Hunter Wilds,"It's basically a movie game. The ratio of gameplay to cutscenes, forced walking (riding) and talking, and linear segments where you're not allowed to run more than a few meters away to grab an item is an astonishingly bad decision. Not only that but the performance is atrocious even with the best hardware that money can buy in 2025. You will still occasionally dip down to 28 FPS with frame gen on with a 9800X3D and a 5080. Absolutely unacceptable for a game that looks this mediocre.Edit: My game just hit 1 frame every 1-3 seconds for about 2 minutes in the hub. :)",negative

Monster Hunter Wilds,"Monster Hunter Wild Review: A Great Game Ruined by Poor PerformanceMonster Hunter Wild offers fantastic gameplay that stays true to the series' core, but its performance is a massive letdown.

As a long-time fan, it's disappointing to see such potential wasted by technical issues. I can't recommend this game until significant performance improvements are made.",negative
Monster Hunter Wilds,"Granted. I'm only about 14 hours into the game (realistically 10 hours discounting idle time), I don't know if I can recommend this game in it's current state. I'm running a Ryzen 7600X, 7800 XT, 32 gigs of 6000MT/s ram, and 60fps 1440p native is certainly not locked even WITHOUT ray tracing AND with some performance enhancing changes to the game's configuration file. The high res texture DLC exceeds 16 gigs vram and increases CPU utilization to hit 100% frequently, so I just leave textures at High rather than Very High.So.... with all this in mind, I'm running the game on an SDR 1080p projector with everything turned up to ultra +rt with FSR nativeAA and having a very smooth, somewhat blurry but still buttery experience.Performance aside....+Combat is good+Weapons feel familiar and powerful+Monsters look amazing and intimidating+Doen't feel grindy, repeating missions is fun.

Never got old.It does feel sort of bad to hit end game so soon for a $70, but Monster Hunter always has a ton of end game content that I am looking forward to get into. My system never crashed FYI even tho others report differently. I played exclusively in single player online. Just a few additional thoughts to add.+Ray tracing performance hit is way less than many other games, in my experience anyway. Typically its a 1-10% fps decrease from off to high on my AMD GPU+Some characters become more likable. I would have appreciated more interaction with Olivia especially+The monsters get so much better in the last half of the game. They were already good, the last handful of fights were super fun-I do not like the Seikret mounts! Aesthetically, behaviorally, and in gameplay they are inferior to Palamutes-As a long sword and switch axe user.... combat was more dynamic and fun in Rise. Wirebugs had my flying around the screen doing insane combos and damage while staying out of danger-""Mount and strike the monstie"" is inferior to Rise's ""mount and drive the monstie"" mechanicSorry for the long exposition.TLDR- Good game. Gameplay good, not best of MH. Needs performance patches. Needs palico cooks.",positive
Monster Hunter Wilds,"This is my first monster hunter game. I spent about 20 hours in the various beta tests. during my time in the beta tests i went from saying ""i've decided this game isn't for me"" to being one of the ones who stayed up way too late on launch night to finally get to play it again. It took me a bit of time to get accustomed to the controls and figure out how to use my character, but once i had it, it hooked me.is it a perfect game? no. it has its problems. but for the most part the problems are more nuisances than anything. To be fair, i have a fairly high end PC built in 2019, and i upgraded my graphics card to a 4080 a couple years ago. I haven't had any problems with performance so far. i feel bad for those that are having issues, but my experience has been virtually flawless.Since this is my first monster hunter i can't really compare it to older monster hunter games. I will say that so far i have enjoyed learning the combat, learning monster patterns and finding new tricks and traps along the way. I have not completed the game, so i have not started into end game, but i don't foresee many problems in end game for my type of play. i don't mind grinding games. i have nearly 700 hours into granblue fantasy relink on PS5 and 200 - 300 in granblue fantasy relink on steam. i enjoy grinding and getting more powerful. so i anticipate the end game will be just fine for me. i will edit my review if that changes.the couple of problems i have with the game are fairly minor. i get tired of monsters running away. and sometimes running for miles before finally stopping; even when they are near death. it gets so old trying to chase them down as your fully healthy bird can't even catch up with something that is hobbling and stumbling away with broken legs and wounds all over it.the other problem is with trying to get into a group with friends. the system is beyond complicated. private lobbies are not easy to use and very complex for your friends to try to join. link parties aren't well explained and make no real sense. squads seem to be something akin to guilds. my friend and i are greatly confused every time we try to pair up. joining a lobby with each other often leads to us not being able to see one another. also, even if we are in the same lobby we aren't able to do quests together, you need to be in a link party for that (maybe? since i really don't have a clue) so it's to the point where we join a squad, a lobby, a link party, and then start a quest. for quests in the storyline if you are trying to do the campaign together, you can fight the monsters as a pair, but its janky. when fighting campaign monsters whoever joins the other one gets sent back to the main camp and from there they have to run all the way to the monster to take part in the quest. a monster that is probably half dead by the time you manage to join their quest and load their version of the map and run from camp to the monster; very cumbersome.i have no doubt that these things will be slowly ironed out over time. it's too bad they weren't solved before launch, but ultimately it doesn't take enough away from the game for me to stop playing it. i am completely enjoying my experience in monster hunter wilds so far and i look forward to putting in many more hours.",positive

Monster Hunter Wilds,"Monster Hunter World is my favorite game of all time, I have over one thousand hours logged on steam.

The game looks terrible. Which is honestly not a deal breaker, but it also FEELS terrible. Constant frame drops during hunts and in the village areas make what is already a poor experience an unplayable one. Even switching to FSR and enabling frame gen DOES NOT HELP, as I can peak 90 fps but still chug down to 30 when turning my character around, making the dips even more jarring.Monster Hunter World looks gorgeous, miles better than Wilds, and runs at a rock solid 120+ fps, no dips, no stutters, no smeary PS2 textures, and no ai upscaling or generated frames.Elden Ring, a beautiful open world game runs buttery smooth with visuals that put this game to shame.Sadly both World and Elden Ring had performance issues at launch that had to be addressed through multiple patches, which seems to be the industry standard now. Hopefully the same happens with Wilds, but until then please DO NOT buy this game. Save yourself the time, energy, and money. I spent 2+ hours fiddling with settings and updating drivers for nothing.  I want to love this game, I really do, but in its current state I wouldn't play it even if it was free. Please do better Capcom",negative
Monster Hunter Wilds,"A great MH entry dragged down by â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ plot and optimisation/DRM issues.The hunt gameplay is amazing, and so are the new monsters. Weapons are fun to play, and they kept the ""quick"" gameplay of Rise when you finish most hunts in 10-15 minutes. The monsters are less twitchy compared to Rise, because, thankfully, no wirebugs. Also, the horrible gimmicky bossfights of Rise are no more - here all the leviathans can be perfectly dealt with by normal weapons, with occasional environmental attacks. No rampages, too, which is also great.Don't believe the people talking about the low difficulty - first two chapters, with 1*-2* hunts are on the easy side, yes, but then the game picks up the pace.Now, to the bad parts.They decided to focus on the plot, and the plot is atrocious. 99% of characters are either boring or off-putting.  You follow a stupid kid whose growth is sort of focus for the story, and also Alma the guild handler who cant shut up about treating things with respect. You go from one primitive village to another, Alma keeps babbling about how you respect the natives, how local ecology is extremely precious, and how you hunt only to preserve the balance and  follow some strict rules or whatever, the stupid kid acts up and says stupid things, and this goes on and on. I have zero idea why they created this atrocity. And the whole stupid kid plot is like the dango girl plot from Rise, just crazy long and not cute.The only thing this slog was good for, it made me miss the comfy village of MHGU and Rise.The second huge problem is they removed all the cantine cooking. Remember the meowscular chef, babushkat, and dango cooking animations? Well, too bad, now you can only whip out your miniBBQ and pan-fry some meat or veggies.Third, the performance is atrocious. Its Dragon Dogma 2 all over again, with RE engine being bad at open world. Moreover, they've slapped TWO DRMS on top to increase the resouce hogging even more. This â¥â¥â¥â¥ is unbelievable.",negative

The recommended specs would get 30 fps on the best of days. With an i5-14400F, RTX 4060, and 64 GB of RAM this game STRUGGLES to maintain 60 fps and often sits at 45 fps on high settings at 1080p.

Monster Hunter Wilds,"Let me preface this by saying that the moveset changes to a lot of the weapon and weather effects in the hunt are very welcome additions and really well executed.As a long time veteran, this is the only pros I can give Wilds sadly.The game runs like absolute dirt, I had to buy and install a frame generator to almost have a consistent 60 fps with a decent rig (obviously not the best but above the recommended settings). That said, performance, as shoddy as it is, is not why I'm leaving a negative review, the main reason is the hurdles needed to be overcame when playing multiplayer;This game suffers from, albeit slightly better, issues that Worlds had. If you want to progress the story with a buddy you need to start the main quests (which are mainly an auto-walking simulator while listening to NPCs talk about their lives and the environments, sight seeing and collecting ressources that will never be necessary in the amounts you're collecting (sorry got sidetracked with this other poor design), find the monster you need to hunt and while your buddies do the same, all the other party member beside player one have to run far enough away from the monster to join player 1 in their quest (if the get touched while loading in the player 1 quest, it cancels the loading) AND walk all the way from camp again to find the monster.The reason I say it's slightly better than world is that at least upon completing that quest, all party member gets the quest completed instead of having to do it for every party members.Also, finding out how to play with your friends is very convoluted, we're talking 4 different list/lobby than you need to navigate in order to find your friends and even then, you can see each other in the lobby (if you join 2 out of the 4 lists), will disapear to them and them to you once leaving on a quest only to see them again when rejoining the quest in progress after the tedious ""quest prologue"".The difficulty in this game is also so trivial that you will spend way more time navigating the menus, partaking in the walking sims and watching (or skipping) cutscene than actually hunting monsters.I'm very confused with the lack of quality control that Capcom have gone away with releasing this title and it pains me as a veteran who want to support them and especially MH.

Monster Hunter Wilds,"I love Monster Hunter. World is one of my favorite games of all time. The gameplay in this is good, because it's Monster Hunter.However, if you aren't already a MH fan - I would stay away:This game looks and runs like absolute â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. Actually, worse. It's pretty impressive that this team was able to take such INCREDIBLE assets like the character models, monster designs, and animations - just to take them all out back, smear them in â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and weigh them down with stones until they flatten into a miserable experience that is barely playable. With a 4070 and i7 14700kf 32gb of RAM I NEED to use a third party program (shout out Lossless Scaling) to make the game playable on medium settings. It looks HORRIBLE. The textures are muddied over from the (again, necessary) upscaling and everything turns into a ghosting mess. FPS will swing +/- 40 frames when nothing is happening at all.Making the deliberate choice to use the RE engine for this after the absolutely abysmal â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ that was Dragons Dogma 2 is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ astounding to me. The level of disconnect between people who actually played this thing before launch and the reality in which we all live has reached a point that it should be studied by psychologists and philosophers alike as an example of incredible survival within a complete delusion and degredation of the mind. It's an affront to the effot of everyone who worked on rest of the game.Don't plan on playing this with friends either, the system for joining and creating parties is, once again, a miserable and complicated experience that's buried within layers upon layers of disconnected menus and constantly changing hotkeys, with three different types of ""party"" for you to be in or out of at any time. If you are looking to pull up a friends list, hit ""invite."" and then start playing? Find a game that respects your time in that regard.I know they still ""got my money,"" and I'm victim to ""I love thing and want thing so I'll play it anyway.""

Monster Hunter Wilds,"Comentario AnalÃ­tico: ""Monster Hunter: Wilds""Se nos introdujo a la 6ta GeneraciÃ³n de Monster Hunter el 27 de Febrero del 2025 por medio del estreno de Monster Hunter: Wilds, regresando a la dinÃ¡mica y estÃ©tica occidentalizada de World en lugar de la jugabilidad fugaz y estilo artÃ­stico JaponÃ©s de Rise.Jugablemente es un total acierto; el combate y la kinestesia es excesivamente gratificante, el Focus Mode es sencillo de entender, los pseudo-chocobos son aÃºn mÃ¡s cÃ³modos que los Canyne y el detalle con el que estÃ¡ dotado cada escenario es milimÃ©trico.El ahora mundo abierto no se entiende como tal, en su mayorÃ­a vamos a trasladarnos por medio de viaje rÃ¡pido y los recursos son recolectables a varios metros desde la montura; esto, sumado a saber siempre la localizaciÃ³n de cada monstruo, puede significar un punto en contra para los habituados a las Investigaciones de World. Por suerte o por desgracia, quienes hayan sufrido los espantosos menÃºs que esta franquicia lleva arrastrando durante dÃ©cadas no tendrÃ¡n que aprenderse nada nuevo, puesto que siguen siendo igual de horribles.Mientras que World se conservÃ³ relativamente complicado hasta la actualizaciÃ³n del Deviljho, Wilds es asquerosamente sencillo incluso para novicios. Es cierto que aÃºn estamos en las primeras semanas posteriores a su estreno y ya hay grandes actualizaciones anunciadas, pero por ahora es un paseo por el parque incluso haciendo una Challenge Run en High Rank.Ya todos sabemos que no hay quien juegue Monster Hunter por su historia, ahora en su mayorÃ­a presente en Low Rank y de mucho mayor peso e importancia que en cualquier tÃ­tulo previo. No obstante aÃºn sufre de grandes flaquezas, y si tanto nos quieren introducir a un mundo y a sus personajes, entonces deben hacerlo bien. Casi nada del argumento trata de monstruos nuevos, todo lo relativo a Gore Magala se presenta por la fuerza y la conclusiÃ³n con Arkveld es demasiado inmediata. Quisiera encajarle varias trompadas a Nata pero es tan solo un niÃ±o; y aÃºn asÃ­ los adultos continÃºan llevÃ¡ndolo a la cuna de los peligros en zonas inexploradas, quizÃ¡ sÃ³lo quieren deshacerse de Ã©l, no los culpo. Â¡Por suerte volviÃ³ Poogie!Respecto a la gran polÃ©mica que lo arrastrÃ³ a una valoraciÃ³n ""Variada"" en Steam; sÃ­, Monster Hunter Wilds corre tan mal como corrÃ­a Dragon's Dogma 2, del que se redujo recursos en pos del desarrollo de Wilds. Son dos juegos preciosos en tÃ©rminos artÃ­sticos, el RE Engine da lugar a una escenografÃ­a fabulosa y muy detallada, pero mal optimizada fuera de escenarios pequeÃ±os de la gama de Resident Evil 7/8 o Devil May Cry. Esperemos que aprendan de sus errores para REX Engine.Â¿En conclusiÃ³n?AislÃ¡ndonos de lo tÃ©cnico, Wilds es un excelente sucesor. TodavÃ­a es muy temprano para dar un veredicto asÃ­ que en prÃ³ximos meses me verÃ© forzado a actualizar esta reseÃ±a.",positive

Monster Hunter Wilds,"I've never returned a Monster Hunter game, but I'm really considering it for this one. Monster Hunter World is my most played game ever, followed by Monster Hunter Rise. I love these games. Even MHW had teething issues when it first released, and it was eventually improved and I was willing to upgrade my hardware to run it better. Wilds doesn't feel that way because:1. It just doesn't look good. Textures are muddy and often incredibly pixelated. Hair, clothing, tents, wood structures, you name it, all look like a phoned-in effort at best. Once in a while you see a really nice texture, which only makes the rest look worse.2. Despite the low quality textures and muddy sheen, performance is miserable. For reference, I'm on a 3080, and no matter what I set my options to, I can't break 60 fps. And once monsters come on screen, or any action happens, it's stutter city.3. I know Capcom is capable of doing better. MHW and MHR both, IMHO, looked better and performed smoother than this one. It hurts to know they can do so much better, but didn't.4. Co-op play is only ""sorta"" there. I buy these games to play with friends, and the way co-op works, you can't play through the story with them. You ""kinda"" can, but not really. It became frustrating enough that everyone basically said they'd just play through solo and consider multiplay when they all finish the campaign. Not the worse issue. Just an annoying one.5. A loss of exploration. They touted that it was a big open world, however it's almost pointless to explore anywhere so far. When playing the story, if you wander too far from where they want you to be, they forcefully rotate your camera back around and tell you, ""no."" They don't tell you where to go, just where not to go. Frustrating.6. Critics have seemingly ignored all of this. I don't why this bothers me so much. I myself am considering holding onto the game just because I love Monster Hunter so much. But the numerous glowing reviews seem very ""off"" to me for all of the aforementioned reasons.Your mileage may vary. I wish you luck. If you have beefy hardware with all the framegen necessary to smooth out this mess, then all the power to you. I tried using the ""Lossless Scaling"" app to add framegen to my own setup, and it helped substantially.

Styx: Shards of Darkness,"I felt greatly conflicted while rating Styx: Shards of Darkness. I actually enjoyed the game very much, and I think it has greatly improved its gameplay both mechanically and directionally upon its predecessor, Master of Shadows. Both are fun games, worth playing because of the strength of the Orcs to Men universe, because of the well-executed in-game mechanics and abilities of Styx, and because of how creative you can be in your approach to levels. Yet while I recommend Master of Shadows, I do not recommend Shards of Darkness. Why this juxtaposition?First, let's address what's good about the game. Mechanically, Styx himself as a character moves more smoothly through the environment and is more versatile than his previous rendition, and I played this game repeatedly just because I enjoyed playing Styx in different ways and challenging myself. He is a well-designed stealth protagonist, with some of the most innovative powers I have seen in a stealth title. The ability to make a clone allows for unparalleled creativity in how you move about the map. Styx can become invisible, and while giving invisibility to a stealth character seems a bit on the nose, it is still balanced because of its relatively short (ordinary) duration and high amber cost (the resource used to fuel Styx's magical abilities). He has more expendable items and a crafting system that allows him to replenish his stock, customization options for his dagger and outfit, and numerous branching paths for his powers. This is the primary reason that the game is worth playing: it's really fun to be a goblin! Props are owed to the devs for developing such a fun and mechanically well-designed character, and if gameplay was all that mattered I could give SoD a 4/5 for this alone.The graphics in this game are beautiful, and the physics are fairly tight. Level design continues to be good, although they sprawl a lot more and have less emphasis on vertical space than the previous game. Vertical space is still very well utilized, though, and I think this has always been one of the Styx games' best selling points. Shards of Darkness provides many interesting stealth scenarios, and the world you're put in is thematic and fun to explore.Now to address the bad: the story is choppy and feels lazy, unpolished, and thrown together. Master of Shadows had a fluid and purpose driven story that gave significance to your actions. Styx's core motivation in this adventure is revenge, which in context seems forced and petty. The cutscenes are animated well enough, but then end abruptly with all of the characters in them having vanished. It's jarring and confusing: when it first happened to me,I was in utter disbelief at the fact that they released the game in this condition. Compared to the well-designed and interesting narration of the story from Master of Shadows, this story and its telling are surprisingly weak.The skill tree can hit a critical mass that breaks the game's back at certain points. For example: a particular combination of items and abilities allows you to remain permanently invisible while leaping from foe to foe, making them invisible and completely silent as they die, and causing their bodies melt without a trace. The ""Quartz"" upgrade to regenerate amber completely nullifies any need to play conservatively, and you can spam abilities with almost reckless abandon knowing that you can hide in a barrel for a minute and replenish it. When you hit these points, the difficulty can nose dive; I played through the game twice, and I decided that I had to put it on its top difficulty and run with no upgrades outside of the item upgrade tree to feel an enjoyable challenge from the second playthrough. This is how I feel that this game is best experienced: there are so many amazing stealth mechanics that they've implemented in the game that are completely voided by some of Styx's upgrade options. I feel his best designed upgrades are side-grades that give him a reward for skillful play while punishing mistakes. The amber dagger is the best example of this that I've found: a legitimate downside that can't be mitigated with other abilities (taking increased damage) for a unique perk (amber regen on kill).Some ability upgrades involve unlocking a different type of kill, or use a new item. These upgrades feel like they should be part of the game from the start, as part of its appeal is how versatile you can be when navigating the levels. Limiting that versatility and spoon feeding it throughout the game makes the early levels feel more stagnant and limited. I feel it would be better to have no upgrade system at all and a complete yet versatile character from the startThe AI seems inconsistently oblivious: sometimes they will spot you from far off, and other times you'll be poking around at their elbows and taking things off of tables right in front of them without them batting an eye.Shards of Darkness sees the return of the abominable parry mechanic from the first game, which will lock you into combat with an opponent who detects you and get you killed because you have to run backwards through the map to try and break it. It is actually easier to play the game on a harder difficulty or while using the tapered dagger because it will disable this mechanic. This target lock needs to at least be toggleable.There are some bad mechanical changes: you can no longer drop bodies off of cliffs, and enemies will no longer ""un-alert"" if they kill your clones. Jump distance is now determined Styx's momentum prior to the jump, and you can't really steer him mid-air to change direction; it's much harder to control Styx mid-air than the first game, and you will fall to your death an upsetting amount trying to get to ledges you can't truly grab.There is a co-op feature, but I have tried several times to make it work and could not find matches at any time of day. Best of luck.Styx's personality has, in my opinion, devolved. He incessantly mocks other stealth titles, his thoughts and musings are more juvenile, and his dialogue is riddled with sexual references and fourth wall breaks. This really takes you out of what is ordinarily an immersive experience. His gruffness and simplicity in the first game were more than serviceable, as he's a sociopathic goblin assassin: he doesn't need to be like a dirty old man. The writing of this game was truly cringe-worthy at times.About halfway through the game there are recycled maps used, which is just lazy. There are some new opponents and objectives added in at these points to try and make it different, but it doesn't cut it.In conclusion, I rate Styx: Shards of Darkness with a 2/5: a below average or niche purchase. Don't get me wrong: this is not a bad or unplayable game. I had fun with it; it falls more into the ""niche purchase"" category than a truly below average game. But it is a niche style of game to begin with, and the problems I've listed are definitely irritating and will make what is already an odd style of game unpleasant for some. It is better than Master of Shadows in some ways: graphically it is improved, and the gameplay is actually better in most respects. Still, the problems I mentioned lower its quality. I had to purposely handcuff myself to get a more challenging and enjoyable experience, and this was worsened by the weaker AI. The parry system and the release of what should be starting content in the form of upgrades are still as problematic as they were in the first game. Recycled maps and jarring, choppy storytelling make the game feel lazy and rushed, and the significant changes to Styx's personality are a huge risk that didn't pay off in my case. If you are, like me, very fond of the gameplay of Master of Shadows and want to experience an improved form of that, this game is worth buying. Its gameplay is solid. But if you have never played a Styx game before or are looking for a more complete and challenging game, see Master of Shadows.",negative
Styx: Shards of Darkness,"There is a lot of good things in this game, and I am torn between a positive and negative review for it.Pros: The game is beautiful to look at, and it focuses almost exclusively on stealth. There are multiple ways to kill opponents, and as the game progresses, a higher percentage of enemies cannot be killed except by setting traps for them. There is an interesting skill tree in which most of the powers have a use and change the way you play. Most other games tend to have a lot of skills that are only useful in specific situations that might rarely ever occur, and feel like they are there to just pad out the skill tree. With Styx, this is not the case at all, and since  you can unlearn skills and use those points to learn others at the start of every level (and sometimes at points during the level), this allows you to try the entire set and pick the playstyle that suits you. The stealth feels very rewarding when you pull it off, as you are up against hordes of enemies as the game progresses, and learning their patrol patterns and finding the perfect moment to slip by feels exhilarating. Since you are powerless to fight back against some enemies, and will be killed very quickly by most of them, there is an immense feeling of accomplishment when you do manage to weave between enemies and get by unoticed.Cons: The biggest problem I have with this game, and the main reason why I decided to not reccomend it,  is the fact that this game decides to make you backtrack every single level you play through for the latter half of the game. You play through five different unique looking levels, and then play those exact same levels all over again with different enemies and a different starting location and different objectives. Playing one level over again is tolerable, but playing all five over again is just infurating. Instead of seeing something new, you see the same exact levels you spent an hour or more in exploring every nook and cranny for another mission. The levels are large, but not so large that it does not take away from the experience. It becomes painfully obvious that this was done to cut corners once you realize that the remainder of the game just involves repeating the same levels. Another problem is that the game feels artificial. The game world does not feel real in any way, since traps are placed conveniently for you over the heads of enemies, barrels inexplicably loaded with acid and perched on the edge of a balcony right where there happens to be a gap in the railing, above a group of enemies. Instead of feeling natural, it just becomes a game of identifying where the developers placed the traps they expect you to use. That really takes away from the feeling of achievement, and ruins the immersion to a great deal. The voice acting is perhaps the worst I have ever seen in a game, with characters all sounding like they have just swallowed a bottle full of oxycontin. They are flat, lifeless, and just painful to listen to.  The story, if it could be called one, is weak and more of an afterthought than anything. There is a plot, and you are after some shards, but the game never takes time to flesh out its world, and each faction you meet is an unknown except for the little bits of exposition you are subjected to in the aforementioned voice acting.Conclusion: Buy this game if you love a stealth title and care more for the gameplay than the story, or better yet, only care abou the gameplay, and do not mind having only five or so distinct levels to play through, and are ok with replaying those same levels for the second half of the game. It has a lot of flaws, but it is an entertaining  couple of hours until it gets repetitive.  Even at its normal price, I would hesitate to purchase this game again, and instead wait until it costs much less.",negative
Styx: Shards of Darkness,"This is the ""AAA mainstream"" version of the original, where controls, dialogue (somehow), story and gameplay are all worse.So controls, they fixed being able to hang off ledges, but instead everything has a delay and Styx will grab anything he can that is remotely near him. If you're near a rope, good luck getting away from it.Also if you're sticking to a surface and press left or right, he moves in increments instead of however much or little you press, which is just mindbaffling stupid.Where the original had tight tolerances, the maps in this one are much more open, but cluttered with enemies. The first time you meet roabies in this one there are eight of them all on top of eachother.The game loves to tell you how things function, but it doesn't allow you to deal with them however you want and a couple of maps in you start getting railroaded.Styx' abilities have been divided out between bloated skill trees that didn't need to be so elaborate and it's obvious that the devs wanted to have you ""make meaningful choices"" with the end of each tree.Why? So devs can feel good about doing ""good development"" rather than giving you a fun experience.As an example, you can either have visualization of footsteps and enemy trails without amber vision OR you can see tokens through walls and nothing else. Tokens give you skill points and maybe achievements, this is completely useless and should've been a suboption earlier on.Crafting has been introduced, but unless you want to spend your hard earned skill points on it, you can only make darts (this game's version of throwing knives) and healing potions. There are lockpicks for some reason, but it is extremely rare that you need any.The maps are absolutely cluttered with crafting materials and if you pick a skill, Styx will go ""hmm"" everytime he's near one. You're always near one, he never stops going ""hmm"", ever. It took me two minutes of that before loading a game to pick something else.For those who like to pick off one enemy at a time in long sessions, this is not like the first game, you are more than heavily discouraged to do so and there are absolute tons of enemies and they are FAR more alert. There's no point to extinguishing torched, because it draws TONS of attention rather than giving you room to breathe.So how about the story/dialogue? You're thrown into some wild hunt almost right off the bat that takes you into a crazy conspiracy, it's hamfisted and full of tropes, which would be fine if it was fun, but it's not.The dialogue is extremely bad even compared to the first game. You will be introduced to elves early on (they've lost their amber sense, so they're effectively the same as humans now...) and whenever you overhear them, they go into long diatribes of exposition read by some intern voice actor who has no idea what setting they're in. American and half-british accents are intermingled and all characters including Styx are overplayed and dumb. Styx spends most of the game breaking the 4th wall which is a lot less fun than it sounds.There is a gimmick boss fight a ways in, which doesn't let you save and has nothing to do with stealth or planning, the game essentially turns into a cover shooter, without the shooting. Absolutely god awful and after beating the boss the first time, I ran into one of the traps and died, having to do it all over. I opted to risk viruses to get a trainer, rather than have to play through that again.Textures are better, but the art style is cluttered and a mess of colors. Despite areas being open they feel claustrophopic and it's hard to tell if someone's there as everything looks so busy.I don't know who made this game, if the devs changed or what, but it's as if someone heard what the game was about and then made it not knowing why the first one was fun. This is a competent game but it's godawful to play, it's like nails on a chalk board at every turn, making your toe curls at how incompetently they've made this.As bad as it sounds from what I'm saying, you can play this without any problems, the thing is that none of it feels good or fun. At some point I gave up trying to explore and kill enemies and instead just followed the railroaded enemy routes in bright light and walked past everything, having no fun and being annoyed whenever the game would slow down and waste my time.Revision: Finished it, it's worse than when I first reviewed it. Absolute trash with a cliffhanger ending that leaves you mind blown that they thought they'd get a sequal for this.",negative
Styx: Shards of Darkness,"The time has come for me to write my first non-recommended review. This game isn't entirely bad; it does have some shining moments and strengths. For example, the level design is excellent. Each level is big and open, offering plenty of opportunities to approach your goals in different ways. The freedom of movement and variety of options make for a satisfying experience. The graphics are pretty good, and the skills you can unlock are also nice. The co-op mode is a ton of fun.However, the game falls short in several areas. The story is practically non-existent. While I didn't expect it to be story-rich, there is a bare minimum to be expected, and this game doesn't even reach that. Styx starts as some kind of mercenary, and the story then shifts to helping someone else, but there are never clear goals or explanations for why you're helping these people. In the first game, Master of Shadows, there was at least a plot, and your purpose and motivation as a thief were clear, but in this game, there is nothing. The story ends abruptly, and the ending doesn't even make sense. I played it with a friend, and we were both speechless.Moreover, you go over the same five levels twice, with only different enemies and goals, but otherwise, they're exactly the same. Replaying a level could be alright if it made sense story-wise, but this is just redundant and lazy. The AI is also a mixed bag. At times, enemies are blind to your presence, while at other times, they seem to have superhuman senses.Styx, the main character, is a cringe-worthy character. He makes bad sexual jokes, curses way too much, and breaks the fourth wall excessively. He feels like a cliche of a drunken uncle trying to be funny at family gatherings. I remembered him to be a grumpy character with some sense of humor, but here they tried too hard.The most frustrating aspects are the bugs and the jumps. We encountered several bugs during our co-op playthrough, including permanent invisibility, loss of all skills for my friend, guards staying on ""orange"" alert level even after we died, and getting stuck in a hole in FPS POV after respawning. Maybe these bugs only occur in co-op, but if the game offers a co-op mode, it should be the same or close to the single-player mode.Lastly, the jumping. It felt stiff and hard to maneuver, especially in the air (I remembered it to be way smoother in the first one, maybe I am mistaken). We died a lot while trying to make jumps, which shouldn't be the case in a game where you can climb almost everywhere.In conclusion, Styx: Shards of Darkness is a decent game, but its flaws make it not worth recommending. Good stealth games are rare, so if you're interested in playing this genre, you should look into Styx (the first one for sure and maybe this one). Still, you should be warned that there are a lot of problems, and you may be able to overlook them. We still had a good laugh in co-op, though, so you could also consider it with a friend. Nonetheless, I wouldn't recommend this game.PS: I wish Steam had a grading system instead of just a thumbs up or down.",negative
Styx: Shards of Darkness,"The game has no ending. Im not gonna lie, i wasn't really playing for the story, just to have some fun with my friend, but there isnt an ending to this game. The ending is just a cutscene with no resolution. If you are going to include a story to your game, no matter how small or stupid it may be, you should at least have the decency to finish it. Other than that, its a decent game, a solid 6/10 on a gameplay front, but the story is a bare minimun 2/10, mostly due to the lack of any form of resolution or completion. Only get this game if you want to have some goofy fun with your friend, don't get it for the story.",negative
Styx: Shards of Darkness,"While the gameplay is pretty good, in the last half of the game maps are recycled frequently and the fun begins to feel bogged down by the increasing uselessness of your abilities. I'd generally give this game a thumbs up though, if it were not for the abrupt ending - it gives the feeling they ran out of time or budget and just cut the game off midway through. There is no synopsis or conclusion.",negative
Styx: Shards of Darkness,"Its a juxtaposed position for me on this game.The good, and there really is good here.  As a true stealth game, the mechanics behind this are well done.  All your choices are risk versus reward.engaging in fights with the enemy is not recommended as Styx is not known for upfront attacking.  Sure you *CAN* engage in a fight but styx is at a disadvantage in a normal battle.  This forces you to choose your engagements and actions carefully.  in addition and due to the afore mentioned ability of styx, exploring the environment also has consequences.  So again risk versus reward.You can't just run around killing everyone and outrightly attacking in borad daylight.  The way it should be with a stealth game.This side of the game is well done.  Really well done.  So big thumbs up for this.Maps.  What there is of the maps (and i will get to the bad, really bad point on this later) are quite good.  They are open with multiple ways to accomplish what you want.  That is great and the variety is there.*HOWEVER*Despite the great game mechanics of a true stealth game there is a glaring, nay glaring does not do it justice.   A monumentous lazy/slack/kick you in the teeth becuase the developer just can't be Ar$ed to do any more coding really horrific re-use of maps.Don't get me wrong, i liked the maps.  But being forced to revisit the exact same maps with an excuse of a poor story line or changing humans to dwarves etc is just plain outrageous.  Its so slack from a development point of view it stinks of the game being abandoned before release where a fresh intern to the unreal engine was forced to finish it just by making you revist over and over and over again the same fricken maps.  Ohh he may have changed humans to dwarves or moved a few collectables around but that is it.  Its a right kick in the teeth.My game experience started very high when i saw the maps (originally) and the open world and multiple ways to accomplish an objective.  Great, i was stoked.  Happy to take the risk to explore.  But as the game progresses and you are forced to revisit multiple times the exact same map you have already painstakingly explored over many save games, well you just can't be bothered to look around any more.The game tarnishes quickly due to this fact.  Its really a cheap and nasty blow to the customer from the developers who are obviously expeptionaly lazy or half ar$ed.Aside from that there are bugs.  Often characters that are supposed to be on a patrol route just get stuck for no reason blocking your way.  Dwarves were stuck in bridges/walkways.   The first real boss fight, after dying the first time, the boss just didn't attack me any more.  i ran around in front of it doing what i wished.Its just do dissapointing that the game starts so well, has a great mechanic and involves you into its world.  Its so good it unfotunately excacerbates the re-use of the maps.Its a fun game at first.  Its not a long game.  But i would not recommend to anyone unless its on a massive discount sale.Shame, real shame.  The game had such promise.",negative
Styx: Shards of Darkness,"I like stealth games, and I prefer it when you are heavily discouraged against combat.This game seems like it would scratch that itch, but definitely fails. It has the right idea, the execution just doesn't back it up.In a stealth game, I would expect the mobility of the character to be very well fleshed out. It is not. It's difficult and annoying to get the character to latch onto or jump to ledges/objects I want. If you get within 2 feet of a rope, you immediately latch onto it, which is not great if you're trying to hide or sneak by nearby enemies. And, just annoyingly, there's a button you need to hold down whose only purpose is to say I DON'T want to walk off the ledge to my death. If you walk near a ledge without holding down this button, the game assumes you wanted to kill yourself and lets you do it.My other main annoyance is that, while I prefer stealth games to discourage combat, it's also nice if that requirement doesn't break immersion. To explain, killing enemies means you lose a ranking (represented as gold/silver/bronze medals). The more enemies you kill, the lower that goes. This makes sense except that there's no story reason (for as far as I played the game) as to why the main character wouldn't want to kill these enemies. They hate and want to kill him and his entire species. And the main character isn't a hero, per se. There's no reason I can determine why he wouldn't want to kill the soldiers, so it takes me out of the game knowing I'd get punished for playing the role in the game.",negative
Styx: Shards of Darkness,"Really loved the first game, but it is clear that there was no passion behind this one. The story is a mess, the level design is levels below the first one, and it is extremely buggy. I faced a bug where an objective did not complete, decided to look it up. The bug was reported back in 2017, and the developer responded to it and received details on how to reproduce it, but it was never fixed.",negative
Styx: Shards of Darkness,"I really tried to give this game a try but the game puts me to sleep and I can't even get past the prologue without losing all interest. The gameplay isn't really anything special if you've played stealth games before. Sneak up on enemies, kill them from behind, and hide them in conveniently placed chests.The main character does have a bit of charm, but it wears off when you realize most of his dialog is one-liners, or anachronistic pop culture references. The only real fun part of the game for me was dying because every time you die you're treated to a short cutscene of Styx roasting you, and admittedly, they are god-tier roasts. His most meaningful dialog I've heard so far.That said, the controls are tight, the premise is at least a little interesting, and the graphics aren't bad but unless this is your first stealth game, you're going to see a lot of the same here in regards to gameplay.Who knows? Maybe I'll revisit it and see if I ""get it"". It's certainly not a bad game, but I'm having a hard time recommending it as it doesn't really do anything for me.",negative
Styx: Shards of Darkness,"Ugh... I wish i had a mixed option.On one hand, it is a good stealth gameBut on the other, it has way more flaws than the original (master of shadows) had.I have almost 2 pages worth of issues, but most of them are minor. The major problems however, are really dumb/impactful.1: The crafting system was â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ unnecessary, and its pointless, give me back the strategically placed item locations from the first game, and get this tomb raider â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of here!2: The tarzan rope is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ awful. Its inconsistent, hard to control, and it never swings the direction i want it to3: I â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ hate what they did to the 'stealth-o-vision'. First, it no longer has the added benefit of also being nightvision, which is a problem because there are a fair amount of crevices where its so â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ dark i can't see â¥â¥â¥â¥ without this. Second, the 'stealth-o-vision' turns itself off if you move. WHY? Why do i have to stay still for it to stay on? I want to toggle it at will!4: The game is really short, like, about 6-9 hours long. If you've played a styx game before it will take less than that. Its really easy to just avoid anyone in this game. I payed 8â¬ for this, which is okay, but this is definitely not worth anything over 20â¬.5: 3 achievements are broken and never unlocked for me. The three achievements are: Trigonal elven system, the gob in a box, and oh my gob!6: The ending is a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ spit in the face! The first game had a nice conclusion, that tied things together, but here, thats not the case. Throughout the game you meet two characters. One is on your side, the other one starts out as hostile. The 'friendly' character is very well written, and just disappears for no reason at the 3rd to last mission. No conclusion to her or anything, which is sad, because she carried this game (along with styx's fantastic voice acting).The hostile character on the other hand, becomes your ally in the 2nd half of the game, with no build-up or whatever, styx and him are suddenly just pals, and at the ending they turn on each other for no reason, AGAIN! Not like it matters, because thats how the game ends. No final fight with him the now hostile person, they stare into each others eyes, and the credits immediately roll.Thats it, no conclusion. Some â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ golem that appears literally 15 minutes earlier serves as the final boss.What happened to 'her'? Why did 'he' turn on styx again? Why can't styx go afterlyssiril? Oh, right, the sequel needs to have a place to start. UGH.TL;DR: â¥â¥â¥â¥/non-existent ending.",negative
Styx: Shards of Darkness,Great game but have to down vote it because I encountered a game breaking bug on Chapter 6 which made it impossible to save moving forward. Had to watch the second half of the game on Youtube.Recommend it otherwise.,negative
Styx: Shards of Darkness,The game is actually unfinished. The last mission ends abruptly and then it's done. Weird.,negative
Styx: Shards of Darkness,"I bought this game because I really enjoyed Styx: Master of Shadows and was looking for more.  In terms of general gameplay it is exactly that.  You sneak around, do optional objectives, enjoy Styx's wit, and do generally shady things.  The game falls short in two major areas, the plot and the bosses.The plot makes it clear that this game was made purely as a followon for Master of Shadows.  It isn't anywhere near as inspired and doesn't really have anything interesting to say.  It is mildly better set up than the plot of Doom, but while character depth and motivation are hinted at existing, very little greater effort is spent exploring those depths.The bosses are annoying.  They're epic, but this is a game where fighting any given random enemy one on one is a bad idea.  The bosses always know where you are.  Unless you use invisibility, you can't hide from them and for a stealth game that is more than a bit silly.  They end up coming off as just parkour challenges that put no stress on your abilities at stealth.  And they're poorly implemented.  The second (and last) one starts with the boss launching massive AoE one-hit kills at you.  They're not terribly difficult to avoid, but the mission starts immediately with these so if you are hit, you have to reload the level (because you can't save in that level before the boss) and skip the cutscene and then get back to the boss fight again.  They're poorly designed and mediocrely implemented.Overall the game is worth playing if and only if you really enjoyed Styx: Master of Shadows.  On its own merits, it falls flat.",negative
Styx: Shards of Darkness,"If they make a third one, maybe they'll do better.By far the worst thing about this game are the two boss fights, unavoidable action sequences that strip away the core stealth gameplay in favor of largely tedious dodging puzzles. On the bright side, the second is much less irritating than the first, with plenty of checkpoints scattered throughout a moderately sized gauntlet of deathtraps that make some token use of stealth mechanics, and in both cases the buggy game code will occasionally trivialize the encounter by rendering the bosses helpless.There are plenty of other gripes, though. Many different controls are consolidated to the same key, which can prove bothersome in many cases where one wishes to do one thing and instead ends up doing another. The breaking of the fourth wall isn't as cute as the developers probably thought it was. Some game systems, particularly the poison mechanic, occasionally just don't seem to work as intended.The ending caught me entirely by surprise - the way the story was heading I was sure I had at least a handful of missions left. I wonder if the developers ran out of funding or time? This could also explain the recycled levels throughout the second act. There are a few decisions you are invited to make over the course of the game, but none of them matter.All these problems are a particular shame because there is potential here. The game has some solid stealth gameplay and a wonderfully unique artistic design. I hope Cyanide manage to put this setting and character to better use in the future, because it could definitely be something special.",negative
Styx: Shards of Darkness,"I love Styx, The voice actor, the music, the look and feel, all top notch. Yet I can not recomend this one and it breaks my heart to say so. I sat on the idea of writing a review after completing the game to see if my mood on it changed, but it did not. The issue for me is the story line. Which for me is a huge part, if it is not for you then great, get the game. All to often in this game I felt like ""Your're kidding, wtf would he do that? this is BS!"". With so many ham fisted plots that do not make sense, and no closure on many things except for one created from the first game and wedged in there, for no real apparent reason why. Even the ending. Completely drops you, and to be honest that was the worst part. The feeling of ""WTF, why are the credits rolling?!? This is NOT the end! Oh FU"" THat feeling has lingered and made me very sad considering how fond of this game I was.",negative
Styx: Shards of Darkness,"DON'T BUY FOR COOPThe co-op mode is abyssmal. Checkpoints don't work (die and start the entire map over), if you're the client your skills will be wiped every time you reconnect, the difficulty is locked to ""everything oneshots you"", which is a bit of a problem seeing that enemies teleport at clip through walls with alarming regularity. My friend and I waited for the coop mode, and it screwed us with a vengeance. There might be a way to play it, though! Just finish the game, unlock EVERYTHING and then you'll be able to do something as a clone except wither and die.PLEASE FIX IT",negative
Styx: Shards of Darkness,"Styx: Shards of Darkness is a game with an annoying reference spouting, 4th wall breaking, drug(amber) abusing goblin trying to get his fix. Strangely I kind of like Styx despite these traits, he's callous, rude, and at times can be funny. The game is lacking heavily in story and has pacing issues that make many of its action scenes comical. The game's ending is an anticlimactic cliff hanagar that anyone could have seen coming, and raises more questions on the point of the entire end sequence than anything else.The gameplay of Styx: SD is good and bad. Stealth play feels great and guards aren't nearly as blind as they are in most games. You have a good amount of abilities at your disposal which support stealth and combat players well. Combat is fairly simple with attacks, counter attacks, and a short dodge roll. I did not use this much as I went for a pacifist playthrough, but did try a little initially and found everything except the dodge to work fine. Boss fights are really lame puzzle solving missions with platforming that has instant death drops from generic laser beams. Platforming is a coin flip on wether or not you will reach your target, or get launched sideways and makes the game annoying at times. The levels are designed relatively well, but they have platforming violent crammed into them by adding these strange wall sconce/hooks everywhere for styx to climb on and it really does break immersion in a way that screams ""VIDEO GAMES!""Story is far from this game's strong suit, to the point of me making this game's review negative suprisingly. Characters just seem to disappear and are never seen from or heard from again. Character interactions are meaningless as everyone just kind of does thier own thing and leaves after your done needing thier help. Spoiler time :DHelledryn gets captured, you save Helledryn, you never see her again. The head of the elves just leaves after her plot fails. Djarak tries to just leave twice and Styx's smuggler friend boaty mc boat face guy just disappears.The final boss fight is so damn insulting and akward, it feels worse than original bossfights in Deus Ex: Human Revolution. You basicly have to hide from a golem that instant kills you as the game uses unclear hiiding spots, and badly wants you to use powers.The game also just ends after this fight with Styx pointing his crossbow at Djarak in an awful cliff hangar.I enjoyed the game but it began to get repitious fast, there's no pay off at the end, and it game is short if you don't suck like I do . _.",negative
Styx: Shards of Darkness,"Let me start this review off by saying that I am a avid fan of stealth games, I played Dishonored 1-3 and most Splinter cell games. Styx misses the mark on various aspects.The AI:I see some reviewers praising this game's AI but I have never seen AI cheat this much on higher difficulty levels. I got grabbed through walls, through ledges and through tables (standing far away from the enemy's grasp) I also hate the fact that these AI can snipe you at ridiculous accuracy some of the projectiles arcs and hits you, they also like to beeline towards you when you are hiding in various spots for no reason. They also get stuck in random walking patterns or turn around every second. The AI Variety is also very bland and overpowered and escaping is very hard.Climbing Mechanics:The controls suck in this game, climbing in this game could've been so cool but was marred by the horrible climbing mechanics, sometimes you can climb a ledge and turn a 90 degree angle sometimes not, and the worst offender is when you jump up or drop down and he fails to grab falling to your death this makes climbing risky and leaves you uncertain so I end up staying on the ground as much as possible.Game Mechanics:The Health bar is mostly for show in co-op since the AI beats the sh*t out of you until you are dead, the skill tree has multiple paths but many of the skills are so useless or just bland and boring almost no sense of progression, your powers are mostly useless the clone is nice and it does work but the invisibility power only lasts for a few seconds before draining your amber/magic, crafting is a slog you have to collect a ton of materials just to craft a single dart or health vial.The Story:The story is pretty much 5/10 the main character Styx is entertaining at times but can be overbearing too, all the other characters are so forgettable I don't even recall their names.Conclusion:If you played Dishonored for example this game will probably leave you wanting more it lacks polish and depth stealth is okay but the AI and Various other mechanics ruins the overall experience 3/10.",negative
Styx: Shards of Darkness,"I bought the game to play with my partner.

Styx: Shards of Darkness,"Must say I'm dissapointed with this one.It didn't have the same gameplay feeling as the previous Styx game, Master of Shadows.He has the same humor and one do laugh at.I found him harder to control with the jumps and what you could grab hold of with edges.It didn't give me the fun or challenge as Styx: Master of Shadows did.Graphics and sounds are good.Just the story wasn't that interesting to me of how it was told and what you had to do.It just didn't feel like the Styx I loved to play in Master of Shadows.I just felt a lot felt lacking in the game and thats why I don't recommend it.",negative
Styx: Shards of Darkness,"I normally don't write game reviews, but I've been expecting this game for a really long time after enjoying the story of Styx: Master of Shadows. I had my hopes up and was waiting for an even more interesting plot with better gameplay and new-found skills. What I found was a bland story with probably the most anticlimactic ending there is because there isn't an ending. It's like those TellTale game series, It just cuts off with no closure. Story-wise, it doesn't really compare to that of the first game. And what bothered me most was the final game gear you get is pretty much rendered useless, because the last mission can't even really be considered a stealth one.TL:DR: The game is more polished and lethal/non-lethal both have more options than before, but the story is banal and it doesn't have an ending/closureEdit: SpellCheck",negative
Styx: Shards of Darkness,"A lot of fun if you're into stealth.  If you liked the first game you'll enjoy this.  They've taken the best parts of the first game and made them even better.  (for instance amber vision is now free to use).  Additionally the four award types (find all coins, don't kill anyone, don't get detected, and complete by a certain time) now have each got Gold/Silver/Bronze levels with different skill points rewarded. haven't tried the coop yet, but so far the single player game is enjoyable.EDIT:The coop is really laggy, which will mean when you thought you were hiding from that guard, but weren't.However, the most unforgivable thing in a stealth game is BOSS MISSIONS WHERE STEALTH IS NOT AN OPTION.  oh yeah.. you can't save either.. and.. did i forget to mention that they're 30 minutes or so each while constantly being blasted with one shot kills?  During those missions this is just a crappy 3rd person platformer.  Think 1980's super mario without the nostalgia.Reviews must punish dev's whom create stealth games, but then make it so they're not stealth games in unavoidable missions.",negative
Styx: Shards of Darkness,"I expected much from this game. I did like the first one even though it had a ton of issues, I expected most of them to be fixed with this sequel. I was very very wrong. NO SPOILERS.This game keeps most of the issues from the first game, the AI has been slightly improved but it's the same robotic monotonous and artificial feeling as in Styx 1, which is a very big deal becuase there's another HUGE problem with this game, the level design. A big improvement from the previous game is that there's a lot more visual variety this time around, from giant zeppelins, to fishing villages and elf ruins, a lot LOT more variety that keeps the exploration interesting. The levels are huge too and really feel like real places, I've been extremely impressed by it, each level just feels so good to look at in the beginning: ""Look how beautiful and packed this place I'm about to explore is"" I thought at the start of every level. However, a couple levels repeat in the latter chapters, as if they wanted to finish the game at once.And the levels themselves, are all the same, more or less corridor but mostly very open labyrinthic levels that feel like real places, as I said. But there always are the same holes with the same hooks to hold on, the same rooms with the same wardrove, the same box, the same food to poison, so even though there's a big visual variety throughout the levels, they ALL play EXACTLY the same, which is a real shame, because that playstyle is not too interesting, the way to beat a challenge is always the same, whether that's with the hooks on the wall, a tunnel beneath the floor or entering the building from a window on the ceiling, over and over, which gets very tiresome after the first couple chapters.Another thing to point out is that the skills are absolutely pointless for the reasons stated above, you can beat everything in the game SO easily without using ANY skills at all, that it's just ridiculous, most of the time you won't even use barrels and stuff to throw over someone or to distract, even that is not even necessary, so when you realize this, the only reward you get from exploring the levels is your own satisfaction and some pretty views.The enemy variety is the same as in Styx 1, but with one new enemy that starts to detect you if your distance to him is lower than X, even through walls, because they can ""smell"" you, so it works exactly like a radar. Except that enemy, everything else is the same.Your tasks each mission have been improved and made more interesting, but beneath the surface, it's always ""Go to A, now go to B"", and the game plays exactly the same on your way to both A and B.The story is interesting, it does have a very VERY interesting and foreshadowed plottwist which I think was absolutely genius and I really really liked it. However, it has the least satisfactory ending I have seen in a long time, you can really see how the developers just wanted to be done with the game. The ending doesn't even have an explanation, it sets up for a future expansion or game, but it's not like you can already understand the ending, it has no explanation, the developers will come up with an explanation when they release their next adventure with Styx. So overall, it has a better tempo than the first Styx since it gives some new interesting plot detail every mission, but the first Styx story was much better and cohesive as a whole, with an absolutely brilliant plottwist, definitely one of my favorite plottwists ever.So this game is NOT a good game, it's a decent game, but it's not bad by any ANY means, it can be very enjoyable in fact, and while I would've given a positive review to the first game, which was objectively worse in nearly every way, and that game could not even be enjoyable at all, I can't give a positive review to this one. It feels like the developers didn't want to fix all the issues their first game had, or at least the most important ones that would make Styx a GREAT stealth game, but no. I will gladly buy the next Styx though, I've got faith on them after all.TLDR: Fine game, not many improvements from the previous one, lazy developers. All the abilities are absolutely useless thanks to the terrible (but very beautiful) level design, thus making all exploration pointless. Buy it at half the price, neither the game nor the developers deserve the full price.",negative
Styx: Shards of Darkness,"Styx: Shards of Darkness is probably a solid stealth game for some people. But for me, and my friend when playing co-op, the game left us in a unsatisfying feeling at the end. Just like a bad new brand of chips, eating the first half is great, eating the other half makes you not wanna eat more.The level design and gameplay was great. I would say the level design, when talking about different ways to approach a situation, was quite varied. In almost all situations, you can avoid & sneak past every enemy on ledges, chandeliers, joists, in barrels, chests, vents & cupboards. Or you could kill them using any of these i just mentioned to your advantage.The gameplay was also good. The amount of control of your character was a bit hard at the start. But once you know the controls, how to navigate the levels and kill enemies in various ways, you could be really fluid with your movements. I had most fun just controlling the character while going to vents, ledges and kill people. It did felt I was an assassin.But why did I still give this a negative rating?Well because of ONE. SIMPLE. REASON.The Co-op.Oh god the Co-Op.So here is the thing, me and my friend did have fun playing Co-Op. But 2 things in Co-Op made the game not a enjoyable experience.The set difficulty and no saving features.In single player, you can set how difficult the game is.But in Co-Op, you had the hardest difficulty permanently on.You can die in one hit.Enemies detect you more easily(and a lot of unfair ways).And no parry(a way to avoid getting instantly killed was disabled).In single player, you can do quick saves and normal saves.But in Co-Op, there was no saving feature. If you make one single mistake and die in the level, you start all the way back to the start.Combining these two made the game not enjoyable. Because the game had side missions & collectables, you have to spend 20 minutes again on that level doing the side missions & gathering collectables if you even die. Nobody likes to spend 20 minutes on something and then lose all of that progress only to start from the beginning of the level. So the only enjoyable option is to skip side missions & collectables.The game became a bit more enjoyable after that. Except the inconsistent enemy detection and start from the beginning because of set difficulty and no saving feature. Even with fluid controls and different level navigation, those two negative factors made the game not fun. It didnât not help when the story became terrible at midpoint of the game.Now Iâm sureIFwe played the game in single player, itâve been more fun than doing Co-Op.Iâm also sureIFwe started playing the gameAFTERthey added in the saving features into Co-Op, the game wouldâve been even more fun.But the game left us not enjoying it. And with the god awful ending, there is no words to describe how much I despise this game for itâs 40â¬ price that included the set difficulty and no saving features into Co-Op.It's the only game I regret spending this much money on it.Iâm sure if you played it now in Co-Op or in single player, you would enjoy it.But at that time me & my friend played it, we didnât enjoy the game.",negative
Styx: Shards of Darkness,Who thought boss fights would be a good idea for a stealth game?,negative
Styx: Shards of Darkness,"Im honostly quite disappointed in this, there are way too many over used references that have no reason to be there, all the mechanics dont feel smooth and you can tell that it was a rushed interface, the new mechanics are really clunky like rope swinging, combat really isnt engaging. It feels really rushed overall and you can tell the developers went for looks over actual mechanics. For a good and challenging stealth game, just replay the first one or play dishonored. and the voice acting while having more diversity is just bad.",negative
Styx: Shards of Darkness,"I bought this game for its co-op and because I played and really enjoyed the previous title. This review is from the point of view of player 2.It lags to the point where it becomes very hard to play. It loses your progress which then makes it very difficult to re-synchronize with your co-op-mate. The game menus are horribly designed. Player 2 often can't see objectives on the HUD for whatever reason. There's the occasional visual glitch with NPCs shown stuck between floors (though nothing of the sort is displayed on player 1's view). The story isn't as good as its predecessor's (at least up to the point where I could stomach playing it - right after it randomly lost my profile). Also the skill trees are bad in this game.Lastly, Styx is really annoying in this game. In the previous game he was comedic and the humor was very dark. In this game they're just trying too hard. It's disappointing. :(",negative
Styx: Shards of Darkness,"The game is a little bit clunky whith its stealth mechanics but still quite fun.BUT there is a game breaking bug where you have to pick up a letter from some human diplomats where picking up the letter does nothing at all. After trying to solve it by following the instructions on some forum posts I ultimatelly gave up after ~1 hour and thought to myself:""If the developers care that much about their game that they don't fix a game breaking bug after over 1 year then why should I care.""So yeah... I would have liked to finish the game. It was quite interesting up to this point. But I do not have the time to try to fix a bug the developers know about and are aparrently not able to fix.The devs are welcome to tell me when the bug it fixed and I might come back and change the recommendation, but at this point I can not recommend buying or playing it.",negative
Styx: Shards of Darkness,"Objectively worse than the first game and I really shilled Master of Shadows left and right.Even tho you have a proper skill tree this time, all your actions feel gutted. The level design is far inferior that what is used to be, and the stages get recycled halfway through.Get it if you really want to play a stealth game. For that it fulfills its purpose.If you want a good sequel tho, you are going to be disappointed.",negative
Styx: Shards of Darkness,"Would be a really great game if it weren't for all the bugs. I was having a lot of fun up until a certain point.Throughout the entire game I found myself constantly failing to grab ledges despite impacting directly upon them, guards seeing and reaching through solid material, aerial kills functioning perhaps a third of the time.The part where I gave up was during a mission where the game would not progress despite the objective very clearly being completed. This is also hardly a new issue, having been brought up March 17th, which the developers had acknowledged.",negative
Styx: Shards of Darkness,"Unfortunately Styx: Shards of Darkness is a downgrade from its predecessor in almost every regard. As such i could only recommend this to people who loved the first game and are desperate for more.The gameplay in Shards of Darkness is mostly the same as Master of Shadows, yet somehow it manages to be easier and more frustrating at the same time. This game commits possibly the biggest crime a stealth game can. Terrible AI. Enemies are incredibly inconsistent. Sometimes they will spot you instantly while you are in complete darkness, and sometimes they wont see you run right past them in bright light. Even ignoring that, the gameplay is just not great. There is essentially no new enemies that were not in the previous game. There is a new type of roabie and now dwarves, but the dwarves are functionally the same as the elves at the end of the Master of Shadows. There is numerous other gameplay issues, such as how they also managed to make turning out torches a liability. Putting out a torch actually makes you more likely to get caught as enemies become alert when they see an unlit torch and path towards it. Instead of putting out torches to hide in the darkness, their only use is to be a mild distraction.But the biggest downgrade from the Master of Shadows has to be the frankly atrocious story and writing. Master of shadows had a very interesting story with good, if rather edgy writing. The story in Shards of darkness is utterly incomprehensible. The main villain might as well not exist, characters never explain their motivations and almost nothing is ever explained. The writing is just groan inducing levels of terrible. Styx now speaks almost entirely in pop culture references and 4th wall breaks and he never bloody stops. The voice acting is also very low quality. There's only about 6 or 7 voice actors in total, and Styx is the only one who is consistently good. The others range from mediocre to just plain terrible.Overall i am incredibly disappointed by this game. Master of Shadows was not a perfect game, but i did like it despite its flaws. i found myself speed running Shards of Darkness as i just wanted it to end. Unless you are desperate for more Styx, i would recommend skipping this game entirely.",negative
Styx: Shards of Darkness,"This is not a very well polished game.The whole co-op experience feels like a last minute addition that haven't really been polished or tested well enough. They might as well have no multiplayer in this game whatsoever and you wouldn't miss anything good with it being gone. Not to say that you're being locked out of most of combat mechanics while playing co-op.The only redeeming point of multiplayer is that you're practically immortal, as long as you have your co-op partner alive you can spawn from them in 10 seconds after you die. But, you can achieve that without having to suffer through multiplayer by simply upgrading some of skills in your clone skill tree.Most of times multiplayer devolves into a buggy mess between AI behaviour breaking often, button input sometimes not registering properly and some desynchronisation between players. A few of the mission quests are bugged, with one particular locking the game with no way to complete it without having to reload and replay the whole mission.Some later levels reuse level stages that were used in prior missions. You can call that lazy or not pay any attention since it's not that uncommon of a practice in current games.Besides that, the atmosphere is pretty nice, Styx himself is a cheeky little bastard. If you want to play this game, you better do it alone unless you want to either laugh with your friends at all the bugs it have or be frustrated about the game breaking often.",negative
Styx: Shards of Darkness,"Product received for freePlayed a ton of dishonored and some of hitman and assassins creed so I feel fairly confident saying that this game just feels off, the movement and graphics are cool but the actual stealth itself along with animations and voice acting are weird, plus having Styx is incredibly obnoxious and not witty at all. Unfortunate since I thought it looked really cool",negative
Styx: Shards of Darkness,"I dont get the point. You have all these cool ways to kill people, but you get the gold medal by killing as few people as possible. You have a lot of things to collect, but you get the gold medal by racing to the end as fast as possible. The movement isn't great either. I try jumping into a window sill and if I don't use jump at the exact location the game wants my character jumps straight up and alerts everyone around me. It's just annoying",negative
Styx: Shards of Darkness,"This would have been a neat stealth game. But it is way to buggy to be considered fun. more than once a bug related to the main mission  made it impossible to progress, and I had to restart the level to replay it. Third time this happened I decided it is not worth it, and just uninstalled the game. Shame.",negative
Styx: Shards of Darkness,"I like the universe of the game and the character - it's good. The thing I don't like though is that you can't actually see enemies until you get to their spawn area - so you pop up onto a ledge and find yourself confronted by enemies you had no way of knowing would be there. You re-load the game and think ""maybe there's another way around?"" and you try. And you fall off things - a lot. And you find another way around, and run into more enemies who don't appear until you're right in their eyeline. Rinse, repeat. Every level is an incremental grind of this stuff and it's just not compelling enough to make me want to bother.I honestly think that there's a good game in there somewhere, but I'm just not motivated to work that hard to find it. I think Tenchu did it better.",negative
Styx: Shards of Darkness,"I just completed the game after 28 hours of play.A bit short. But then again, I suppose I didn't really want more of it.Styx: Shards of Darkness is a rather lackluster take on the stealth genre.It had begun to feel quite repetitive and the number of re-used levels really didn't help.If you really enjoy creeping around unseen you might like this game, but you shouldn't expect much from the puzzles or the story.",negative
Styx: Shards of Darkness,"This game is player vs controls and bugs in current state.Pros:* Graphics* Stealth game* Styx and characters in game* Skill systemCons:* Controls* BugsThose two bad things pretty much ruins game. Good controls should be priority #1 in this kind game, because it is very annoying that your characters dies even when you do things right. So sadly, can't recomment this game.Examples of bad controls in game :* Game highlights where you end when jumping and shows ""press space to jump here"" icon. You hit space, character misses that grap spot anyway, drops to floor and dies.* Game does not notice enemy is in front of you and does not allow you to kill it. Enemy notices you after couple seconds and alerts -> character dies.* There is no way to tell if button does what it usually does before pressing it. This usually happens while climbing ropes you click button, but instead doing what you expected it, sometimes character just decides to drop/jump other direction and die.Examples of bugs in game :* NPC characters get stuck to environment... Good thing is that you can dance around them and they can do nothing. Still really annoying bug that happens a lot.* You can't take item from right next to you until you move around a bit and game notices that there is item... usually that takes couple seconds, which can be enough to NPCs to notice you and once again character dies.",negative
Styx: Shards of Darkness,"If i enjoyed the former version of Styx. Yet this one, unfortunately, is ridiculously lazy.The flaws from the previous games are still there, it still is technically below the standards of the generation, the story is still predictable and poorly written.But in this one, Styx is actually rude, annoying, on the whole unfunny. You see, there are characters made to... ridicule the player. Telling you how much you suck. but there's a way to do it. Handsome Jack is a good example, but Glados truly is the best. Both are marvels of irony and corrosive humor.Styx... is rude. Flipping the bird, saying duck every 2 minutes, teliing bad jokes i mean, most of the time it just falls flat. And it gets me out of the game.It's not completly bad tho, but it's too easy, the AI sucks immense penises, the characters are dull, it's short (tbh, i'm glad it was) and worst in my opinion, there's close to no improvement over Styx Master of Shadows, which i actually recommend.It might seem weird, but please allow me to explain.When a 6 yo comes with a drawing that actually is impressive for his age, you'd congratulate him.If that same kid comes, 6 years later, with the same kind of drawing, you'd tell him ""eh, you should be doing a lot better by now"". And that's my point. It's their 3rd game with Styx. The first one wasnt my cup of tea, but the second one was a lot different and overall better.This one is lazy. They were so lazy they used most levels twice.....I wont recommend it. At least not for 40â¬. Not even for 20. 10 or 5 at most",negative
Styx: Shards of Darkness,"AI, youre gonna spend half the time going how the â¥â¥â¥â¥ they see me through a wall, and the other half why he got eyes on the back of his head, they usually get stuck trying to go somewhere.usually just means its just weak AI, and when playing AI games, it means everything,.way too many glitches going on this game, very poorly made, poorly tuned. just great graphics and diverse enemies.but definitely doesnt outweight how poorly made the game is. at some point i get to the dwarven rock golem boss, i die and revive, he just straight up disappears, and its not like hey i won the game, I straight up cant move on because he didnt destroy the pillar for the character to run across quite literally gamebreakingly â¥â¥â¥â¥",negative
Styx: Shards of Darkness,"This game starts off alright.The visuals look pretty nice for the first couple levels, the level design is alright and then after it all sinks in you see the flaws- The animations are horrible (not for all things, just enough to make you hate it)- The mechanics barely work- You get spotted through walls- A lot of the time you won't grab ledges and you will just drop to your death and if by some miracle you don't die you'll e spotted for no good reason and killedOne of the major problems was that the co-op is broken. Me and a friend brought this because it looked like a good co-op experience, boy were we wrong.As it was my friend that hosted I got the pleasure of lagging around all the time which meant that jumping from ledge to ledge was even harder and I'd get spotted for no good reason.BUT the WORST thing of all...After we finished it finally we were watching the credits together and then all of a sudden, BOOM. THE GAME CRASHES!I have nothing but absolute hatred for this game at this point.",negative
Styx: Shards of Darkness,"Shocking effort. There's a game-breaking bug in an early level which requires you to steal a letter, but the objective doesn't trigger when you pick it up, rendering the game impossible. Restarting the zone made no difference, apparently it helps to hear all the guard's conversations for it to progress properly, which would be doable if Styx didn't keep interrupting them with his utterly inane and useless comments.And the rest of the game (or at least what I managed to do)? The sequel was just a straight rehash of the far superior original which fails to improve on any of the problems of the first game. The platforming still sucks, the physics engine is still hopeless, and the levels are smaller this time around. Hardly Thief II. Avoid.",negative
Styx: Shards of Darkness,"This was a decent follow-on to the original game. The story and premise were engaging; game mechanics were solid; the gameplay was enjoyable, the dialog well-written - but the ending was terrible, awful, and bad. There were plot holes big enough to drive a truck through. Recommended only if it's on sale. Don't pay full price for this!Spoilers below:So we learn that the dark elf queen can sense where Styx is at - but nothing was ever done with this. Why? The queen is a really two-dimensional character. I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop here, but poof, nothing.When Styx spoils the plans of the queen, there is no resolution here to speak of. She and her cohorts vaguely ""escape"", and that's it, she's gone. Considering the horror that she and her minions enacted, this is a giant let-down.Speaking of the ""horror"" - man, that is a sh**load of amber they collected. Just how many billion ""units"" did they have to process to collect all that amber? It makes no sense at all.The ending is a total letdown. Seriously, what person on the story team thought that was a good idea? A final confrontation with the dark elf renegade ends with...nothing but a truncated cutscene? Then the credits roll, and Styx is magically back at his hideout.The end boss is an exercise in frustration. There are no manual saves allowed in the final ""level"". If you get killed before you get to the first autosave, you get sent all the way back to the previous level.Speaking of the end boss - it's ""hinted"" at a couple of times, but the appearance of this overpowered boss doesn't make much sense. There's very little reference to it at all previously.The whole ending smacks of ""Sh**, we're out of budget and time. Let's just throw a giant f*****g monster in here and call it a day.""",negative
Styx: Shards of Darkness,"Really poor transition from Master of Shadows. I finished the game only because of how much I loved the first, but it never got more rewarding. The addition of ropes was hardly the massive new dynamic they seemed to have expected (you still can't stick the dagger in banners and using that to slide down distances), the boss fights are atrocious arcade-game breaks from the reason you purchased the game and functionally the exact same boss fight with a different skin, the dwarf enemies smelling your location wasn't compelling or difficult to get around but instead just odd and a clear attempt at trying to make them in some way different (whereas the thing that made the elf enemies different and unique from the previous title--being unable to kill them from the ground due to the height difference--has been removed). Armored enemies are everywhere, giving you less opportunity to be a murderous Goblin killing about everything in your path, and the level design in general is far worse than the previous title.There's also no night vision unlike in the first, which constantly has you stumbling about and trying to figure out if you can make it through a particular passage, which was probably my most constant annoyance. The idea of a sheath was a bad one, it got rid of the silhouette of the skulking Goblin we know and love, the cover option to slide around walls is almost constantly broken by random flavor objects in the scenery, and the weapon crafting system is a bust, feeling like a tedious version of restocking that made no sense (he turns Iron Ore into darts in moments), and the decision to get rid of throwing knives for darts was really poor as well. Glitches happened just frequently enough to make them obvious, including the final cut scene of the game being ruined by my character falling through the floor (still don't know what happened).The scenery and environments are beautiful but there aren't many so they quickly become stale. In addition to being too dark to really appreciate with the previously mentioned lack of night vision. Also, the character dialogue is much, much worse, with Styx himself being the worst offender. The constant fourth wall breaks tear you out of the game constantly, and the steady stream of modern pop-culture references are too-oft repeated, especially when they weren't funny in the first place (there is a crystalline resource in the game that you break to harvest, there's about one a level, and every single time he'll say after busting one ""Not breaking this would be bad""). The game feels like Styx went from an interesting perfect capture of a grimy, murderous, sociopathic Goblin to a cheap Deadpool knockoff that's done poorly.The game is playable, and not so bad that you'll want to quit playing it partway through if you're committed to learning the story and finishing it (you'll have no reason to otherwise, I often found myself wanting to Google the total number of missions to figure out how much more I had to do, rather than exploring every nook and cranny to get the most playtime out of the game), but it's so lackluster in design that it almost feels like the game was worked on by an entirely different team. Don't buy this unless you're a big fan of the first one, and even then get it on sale.Edit: Most of my hours came from having this game on while I was at work. I did not get 200 hours of playtime out of this game and again the playtime I did get out of it was a drag.",negative

Styx: Shards of Darkness,"I love this game and want to recommend it but I've been trying to get some form of support for a widespread audio issue that causes sound to not play, which is completely unforgivable in a stealth game. I'll be more than happy to write a lengthy, happy review when I can play this game that I paid $40 for again, until then, this is staying up in hopes that it gets someone's attention.Edit: It has been two years with no fix. Multiple other issues relating to audio and input have been ignored as well.",negative
Styx: Shards of Darkness,"this game down right pissed me off. it is one thing to have a game set up so bad that you die constantly, it is another for the game to make fun of you for it. the game may even have been tolerable if you could turn off the repetitive death screens.so you have a knife. you can only pull it out when you are targeted, not when you are going to prepare to fight. you can't use the knife to attack. you know, a weapon used for slicing and stabbing? ya, you ""perry"" with it... sure. if you miss-time the first swing you have to get attacked the second time so you can try to time the next hit. some people kill you in 3 attacks, some with 2. magically some can throw a knife at you from 100 yards away and kill you in one hit. even at full healthcroutch walking by a building? yet the 7 people inside are now agro'ing you. window? nope, these people can see through walls. hit an noise making object? nope a mouse must have farted and spooked them. someone agro'ed you? well be prepared to wait 5 minutes for the agro to go away, and sometimes don't even go near you. but if you move and NOT wait he'll be ready to throw a knife at you from accross the stage.a dead body can rase an alarm, but you can't hide the body. you can drop them off the edge into the water, but your feet are not where your feet are and you now fall to your death. if you don't go RIGHT up to the edge when you drop the corpse you will get their head caught on the floor and they'll hang there.see that rope, well there is a 50/50 shot it is climable. on the ledge moving right? randomly the camera angle will change, your character is now looking up and you stopped moving. don't worry though, because while you battle trying to continue moving on the ledge a guard will see you and help with his stabby stick.you can jump from 30 feet high, but 31 will hurt you and 32 will kill you, even if it is a soft roof. somehow you can fall from a rope at 50 feet and be ok. sometimes you will see a rope that you reasonably can jump to, well it is 2 inches to far away and you fall to your death. need to hang to the ledge below you? fall to your death.upgrade the ability to fight with the knife? apparently not. upgrade the arial attack? well... you can jump infront of the enimy and they can stab you...WINNING. didn't get to upgrade much, but so far they don't seem to work.this is one of those games where you are fighting a battle, not againct the enimy, but with the game itself. you make so many mistakes trying to understand the limitations of what you can interact with, and when you think you figured it out, you find out this time the rules change, and just before a savepoint. so all that 30+ minutes of work you put in clearing everything, despite the game, well get prepared to do it all over again. this isn't a game where ""Get Good"" applies. you don't get better at the game, you just learn the mistakes that are still left in the game, and how to adapt to them. not enjoyable.what really pisses me off is that i wanted to like this game. i really did. it looked really good and the gameplay looked fun. the humor seemed to be right up my ally and i had high hopes. the damn thing is just way to buggy. when i play a game i expect to fight the enimy, not the programmers.",negative
Styx: Shards of Darkness,tldr: Only buy it if you have already played the original Styx and love it and can't hold yourself from trying regardless of how bad it is.Unfortunately I would have to down vote this game. I played Styx: Master of Shadows long back and was a fan ever since but the sequel is a complete shadow of the original game. It's quite visible the budget for this sequel was too less but the game mechanics itself are very contradictory. It has secondary achievement in every mission that are:- swiftness: the  fast you finish the mission the betterBut what is the point of a stealth game when all I'm doing is speed running trough the missions?- mercy kills: the less people you kill the better zero is the bestBut if I don't kill anyone then what is the point of having a comprehensive skill section around stealth and combat? What is the point of upgrading skills when it's useless for achievementsthese stupid achievements that are always in the background telling you that you're losing the score just makes it more miserable. I'm an assassin maybe I want to kill someone?I completed half of the game without any skill unlock just trying to get the achievements and it made the game so boring. All I was doing just sneak and run fast from one place to another and trigger a cut scene. The need for unlocking the skills didn't really felt important until decided to ditch the entire secondary achievement and just started playing it for fun.The story is average and cut scenes and dialogue are poor but when you're playing Styx you don't really care besides the main character and the game mechanicsOn the bright side there is rarely any bugs except sometimes enemies just see you from way far randomly.,negative
Styx: Shards of Darkness,"The game is solid as stealth game, but not impressive as other awesome stealth game like Mark of the Ninja, Dishonored.Gameplay was fun. But i don't want to play it again. It's strange because i always have replayed other stealth game as beating all levels.",negative
Styx: Shards of Darkness,"The gameplay is alright, its fun to play with friends, but a lot of gamebreaking aspects. I have a fine pc with 1070 GTX 2% bottleneck. The game should be fixed for its price. I got a Fatal Error during the gameplay after the mission ""steal maolak's pendant"". I reinstalled, did some fixes the devs suggested in previous solutions, but nothing worked. If you bring out a game, make sure its fixed. Storywise, the game is nice, but not worth the money because I'm not able to play further because of this Fatal Error.",negative
Styx: Shards of Darkness,"We tried Styx: Shards of Darkness in co-op with a friend for about three hours, but we really didnât connect with it. While positive reviews highlighted its nice graphics and interesting level design, we found the game lacking in overall appeal.The character controls were frustrating, and despite some visually appealing elements, the gameplay just didnât feel engaging. In the end, it wasnât a satisfying experience for us. â installed and uninstalled just as quickly.",negative
Styx: Shards of Darkness,"There is no way to play the game that the developers did not explicitly intend you to play it, and I don't like the one single way they made to do so. This game is for the people who like homework, playing through the levels over and over again, making constant mistakes and reloading after every instant-kill (or alert), learning everything about them until you can finally accomplish that one run where everything goes right and you actually have fun. I'd prefer a fun experience the first time, and then never play it again.On the upside, they did improve lots of things from the previous game, especially the autosaves. Best played on gamepad.",negative
Styx: Shards of Darkness,"After playing the first one, and playing many stealth game in the genre. I really want to tell every one to play this game, but its gots a lot of problems. I feel this game wasn't even tested the bosses will just get stuck in movement with just a reload. The patrols will get stuck in the enviroment, hell a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ bucket. I feel most of the levels are just copy and paste ideas from the first. Then their is styx who was a great character in the first game then in this one they make him spurt all these pop culture references that are really poor placed and all the fourth wall breaks is just distasteful for this game. So just remember the first one was at least a masterpiece unlike this junk...",negative
Styx: Shards of Darkness,"So I tried to like this game. Really tried. I like stealth games and rogue characters but this game just kills me with the controls.Sometimes he grabs the edge and sometimes he doesn't. The enemies are just everywhere at times and you have to confront them it seems in order to have any chance of passing the area. Sand just seems to be useless with some of the other items expect for the arrow.Like I said, I really did tried to like this game and changed the controls to something I am more used to. However even with all that, the controls are just terrible and he seems floaty and refuses to grab the edges at times.",negative
Styx: Shards of Darkness,"I changed my mind about this game after paying it a second time.First problem is the story, which is nowhere near the story of the first game. It also creates a lot of plot holes just for the sake of some references.Second is clunky controls. Pretty much nothing was changed since the first game and I can't even count how many times I died because character refused to grab onto a rock or jumped too far.Third is a lack of new mechanics and abilities. Even ""amber vision"" became worse than in the first game, because you can't see s**t in the dark when using it. Also I don't understand why it turns off after random period after pressing right stick.Forth is cutscenes. Some of them are great, but most are really badly animated.Also, the ending is a cliffhanger. So I can't really recommend it to anyone, especially to the fans of the first game.",negative
Styx: Shards of Darkness,Buggy game. 5/10.,negative
Styx: Shards of Darkness,"Its all fun and games untill you get to a really, REALLY boring boss that you cant fight with stealth or anything, its just running from cover to cover and if you die, even after the boss is dead, you have to start the whole thing again. Sucks, because up to that point the game was ok.",negative
Styx: Shards of Darkness,"Initially I started with THIS Styx title before playing Styx: Master of Shadows. And I'm pretty sure I did cause it had co-op or something. And I DID somewhat like it at the time.But I enjoy the art direction, music, writing, movement, and Styx himself WAY more in Master of Shadows. I don't know what they were thinking turning him into some kinda Deadpool goon. It's just annoying.I'm sure I could articulate my displeasure with this game better and provide better points but I don't feel like it.On the plus side there's a larger variety of play styles thanks to outfits and knives. So that's kewl, get this game on a sale and goof off with a friend in co-op.",negative

Styx: Shards of Darkness,"I actually enjoyed the first Styx, enough that it was sad that it was over and actually played it through again just before this newest release came out. Much has changed in the second release, much of it becomes obvious very quickly when playing it. I want to be fair and I want to be clear.1. The first games graphics were clean, bright and the perspectives were enormous enough in the immediate location around you to allow you to get a sense of perspective of where you were, where your enemies were and are. The second game, with the graphics turned all the way up are nothing close to the original. Gone are the brght colors, the clearness of detail and movement. Folks, the graphics on Styx 2 are poor, the perspectives are poor, poor enough to deeply effect the game right from chapter 1. In fact, the small taks set before an experienced player in the very first chapter are made much more difficult by not really knowing depth....right infront of you. So disappointing, so materially damaging to the playing of this game. Even if the castles appear later on the first chapters are simply such a drag as to make a player turn away.2. We have abandon the simple controls of game 1 and replaced it with layer of buttons to do the same thing...or less. Expecting to pick up the materials you need for the two top Life and Amber? Forget it, none to be found, if you play for stealth and move efficiently PAST the point of concern....well you have just left behind ALL the ingrediants to MAKE things that should be laying around. In short, a more complex game is nothing more than an interruption to STEALTH. Worse you can only make what you need at specific points in the game....STEALTH.....S-T-E-A-L-T-H3. QUIET kills, a staple of the first game are a mixed chance of muffle screams and grunts that DO alert those around that should not be alerted. More on this....I used to hink that folks complaining about pary in the 1st game were unskilled. I could parry and decisively win every encounter that it was allowable. NOT IN 2....DEAD ON ARRIVAL. Click...click!....Click!!!...DEAD.4. Sand lights out are LOUD enough that it seems that everyone everywhere needs to investigate no matter how far they are from the source. Bscause of the limited distances in this game, no surprise.5. The save system is enough to make one STOP PLAYING. Reloads are way, way, way, way, way (get the point) too long. One would have to stop and SAVE every 5 mins or start over. What a drag! Did you let folks play this before release?6. Climb a rope....perspective is 6 feet.....view is 6 feet.....chance, luck, randomness.....all of it materially distracting from STEALTH.Lastly....find the sadly limited soul that thought having every ""restart"" slow the same insulting clips over and over again and give them their real job, selling pencils. Seriously sad and misplaced.I am writing this at the airship chapter. Not sure I will bother going any further.....and as I said.....I really enjoy #1 but this one is so much more....of less STEALTH ELEGANCE.",negative
Styx: Shards of Darkness,This game is way worse than first one. First of all coop is bugged. 1. You are forced to use SAM coz achievements wont show. 2.

Styx: Shards of Darkness,"WARNING: I purchased this for co-op and only play it with my friend. This review is for those people who are planning on playing with someone.Do not get this for co-op. I don't know if its me or not but the lag between co-op client and host is horrible. Tried lan and got a 3 second delay between what I thought was happening and what actually happened. Triend over the internet and got better results? What? Tried on my other gaming computer and had similar results. It really does horribly with latency. They need to fix it before the co-op is playable.Single player: Not sure. Played for a few minutes but I tend to not game much on my own. There should be plenty of other reviews available that talk more indepth about actual mechanics and single player aspects. They might be fine but not what I play for.EDIT: Really though, please consider this game for single player if you love stealth and enjoy goofy 4th wall breaking humor. It's not bad but it is broken for co-op.",negative
Styx: Shards of Darkness,"This game is NO COOP. It is a single player game that got a coop mode patched into with brute force.Expected the typical bugs: Enemies that make a finishing move on player 1 are invicible taking 2-3 seconds for the animation, then idle a second or 2 and then directly go over into killing player 2, being invicible all the time.So truly: This is NOT a coop game.And the game mechanics are broken regarding all combat, so avoiding it is by far the easiest solution (even though it is supposedly more difficult according to the game experience reward. But actually, it's just plain boring. Standing, waiting, moving, repeat.)",negative
Styx: Shards of Darkness,"Alright, but Likely Not Worth Your TimeI just want to preface - this game isgood, just not fantastic. And in a gaming world saturated with content, I just don't personally think one is worth the time.Let's start on a high note:the good. This game knows what it is. It's a stealth game and plays like a stealth game. Face-to-face combat is impossible, but that's okay because you shouldn't be getting caught anyway. Each level is pretty sprawling and has some cleverly designed areas to explore. You're almost always given a direct route through enemies, but you're also encouraged to find some other way to get to your destination. Exploring and successfully routing around enemy paths is satisfying, and there are even some unique rewards you can get for finding and completing side quests while exploring some levels, although it's rare. The in-game graphics are surprisingly pretty, and there's even a good sense of aesthetic and world-building in this gritty little adventure. Styx as a character is a witty, nihilistic, fourth-wall-breaking ball of charm which really added to the flavor of the game.My biggest complaint of Styx is thatthe game is plagued with tedium & repetition.You'll find yourself pretty amazed in the first few levels, only to discoveryou'll repeat those same levels for the rest of the game. They only really circumvent this by opening up different areas, changing around objectives, etc., but it wasn't enough for me, and I quickly found myself bored with the repeated designs. Even when they would introduce a new level, the general objective was always the same: go point A to point B to point C and leave the level. Ultimately, this is why I have to draw the line -it just wasn't worth the time & money for me. There are much better and more expansive games out there in the genre.The repetition was by far my biggest complaint, but not my only one. The game does try to add some spice via RPG elements - crafting, leveling, and customization. These were nice to have, but I would've liked to see some more clever or impacting items. See also: lackluster voice acting (aside from Styx),terriblecutscenes & animations, tedious & out-of-place boss designs, little feeling of progression, convoluted and abruptly ending story.I think I'll be keeping watch for any subsequent games in the series, but I'll also be looking for vast improvements in the areas I just mentioned before I would consider buying it. As for this one, I wouldn't personally bother, but if it's cheap you may find it worth your time.",negative
Styx: Shards of Darkness,"This game is funny to slog through in co-op but it is a deeply frustrating experience only made bearable by playing it with a friend. Getting the medals is annoying and the parkour is absurdly inconsistent, constantly failing to grip onto ledges that are obviously in range and making weird jumps you did not intend. Of all the game's problems, the parkour is by FAR the biggest and the only reason I could tolerate it was playing in co-op with essentially infinite respawns. If I was in singleplayer and had to reload a checkpoint each time I died to the game making me fall to my death, I absolutely would have stopped before 2 hours and refunded.The story is also exceptionally boring and un-engaging and Styx is incredibly annoying to listen to, particularly because the writers clearly think he is being very funny when I only vaguely smirked at maybe one of the jokes in 12 hours of playtime. The character animations in cutscenes are also really janky but the game is insistent on showing these poorly-made cutscenes and putting the bad animation front and centre.The crafting system is not good. There's no reason for it to exist other than what is clearly just an attempt to chase the trend of crafting systems that was popular when this game was developed. Gathering materials is very tedious, especially since almost all the materials it gives you are ones you do not want.The combat sucks, which could theoretically be fine if the game didn't have so many abilities clearly trying to push you towards combat. Stealth games having clunky, janky combat is not inherently bad because an awkward combat system is a way of motivating you to stay in the shadows and not fight to begin with (such as in Thief). However, I do not think this game is actually intelligent enough to deliberately do that. I think the combat just sucks.As mentioned the medals are very annoying, but especially the Mercy medal, which feels excessively arbitrary and gamey. There are very few non-lethal abilities available, but unlike a game like Dishonored which makes a point out of you choosing to restrain yourself when nobody can stop you (and still has more non-lethal options than this game), in Styx you are a goblin that has absolutely no reason to value the lives of his victims, and absolutely nothing changes except getting a gold medal if you refrain from killing.The bosses are uniformly awful, except for the final boss which was only made tolerable because the game bugged out and simply never spawned the boss at all. Luckily we were able to cheese through what would have otherwise been a soft-lock by throwing a clone using a cocoon to clear a gap.The level design isn't necessarily bad - though some levels are egregiously laggy when looking in certain directions even on my high-middle range PC - but it is incredibly lazy that several levels are just straight up re-used with no changes except the placement of enemies and objectives. The theme of repetition is also in the music - the music is not very inspired at all and it really numbs your mind when the same bland tracks are repeated over and over and over.All in all you should avoid this game like the plague. It has frustrating mechanics, a boring story, repetitive levels and music, and insufferable chronically unfunny dialogue.",negative

Styx: Shards of Darkness,"I really want to recommend this game. I really do. I love this franchise and what hey did in Master of Shadows was extraordinary.But I do not know what happened here. They ruined it. They should have stuck to what they started without experimenting too much.Pros:Better graphics than the first oneMore reliable climbing mechanic (less buggy, and more variety)Everything we love about our goblin assassin is in this game too with his personalityEven more gadgets to kill/distract your opponentsAnimated cutscenesCo-op gameplay!!! (You can play your game with a friend or a random person)Memorable new charactersCons:Mediocre story (more of an adventure or spinoff than part of Styx's story)Voice acting of side characters, NPCs needs improvementOld reported game-breaking bugs that were never fixed4th wall breaking: During the game Styx would speak to the player, knowing he is controlled. This is a huge immersion-breaking issue. I know they wanted to try something new but since neither Of Orcs and Men, nor Master of Shadows had this... it was strange and unusual to have this. I recommend not to put this in the next game. Just let Styx explain everything in his monologues as he talks to himself like in the previous games. Please note that now there are death scenes included and I am not talking about that.Inconsistency: This is the major reason why I cannot recommend this game. It is like it completely forgets what happened in Master of Shadows and what will happen in Of Orcs and Men later. I will not go into detail because I dont want to spoil it but... you will see it if you try it.During the first gameplay I was only a bit confused but as I repeated the missions and thought about it... I realized it just didnt make any sense and this is why I dont play it anymore.So yeah. I love the franchise, I like the developers, I adore Styx but... This game? Nah.Perhaps the next game will be better.",negative
Styx: Shards of Darkness,"if you have really low expectations of stealth games, this might be acceptable. I can't be bothered though. it's way over rated. the checkpoints are atrocious and force you to complete monotonous walking simulator sections and looting for no reason other than to waste your real life time. the stealth mechanics are questionable. hiding inside containers is pretty pointless because enemies see through them and will always pull you out and kill you even if they didn't see you go into the container. enemies are better than you at everything and will chase you endlessly and there's nothing you can do because styx is a slow â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ who can't run. enemies will also routinely spot you through solid walls that they shouldn't be able to see you through, or they will spot you behind them because their vision cone doesn't match their character's animation, which makes every single encounter a exercise of trial and error. not sure if this is just a bug or bad game design.a lot of sections are designed around abusing x-ray vision and other absurd super powers which makes this game less of a stealth game. don't expect any immersion whatsoever.so far the stealth is nothing more than trial and error until you memorize every enemy and item so you can speed run from the horrible checkpoints. it's just bad. experimenting/learning or having any amount of fun is punished with being sent back to repeat boring looting/walking sim sections before you can get back to the part that you actually died at.",negative
Styx: Shards of Darkness,"It's a decent stealth game, but as a sequel it's mistakes cannot be overlooked. It makes all of the same mistakes that the first game made and the overall story isn't even remotely interesting... the ending is just bad. It doesn't even feel like a complete game with that ending.If you're really desperate for a stealth game, grab the first one. If you really liked the first one (flaws and all), then sure, pick this up. It's a lot of the same... Though, the boss fights both create crappy save points requiring you to skip cutscenes or deal with loading screens.",negative

Styx: Shards of Darkness,"TL;DR If you pick this game up for dirt cheap like I did, and enjoyed the first one, then it's fun, but don't expect much or a polished experience at all. Otherwise I can't recommend.I can't help but feel the game was rushed, and it shows pretty much. You can't even 100% the game, because the collect all achievements trophy is bugged and still isn't fixed in 2022.I love the improved artstyle, although the animations in the cutscenes are way too over exaggerated.The core gameplay is still fun, there are some interesting new concepts and some questionable choices.(to name one, for example the rope swinging control being completely independent from the player's camera)I loved the idea of the alternative approaches in mission objectives, given of course the game doesn't bug out and gives you the option as intended.Some locations are beautiful especially the first levels, but you will revisit levels way more often than you did in the first game, and with even less modifications than in the previous one. It also feels very short. (my 40 hours + gameplay contains huge amounts of AFK, and trophy hunting)Amber vision no longer helps you to see in the dark which is quite annoying.The skilltree is anticlimatic.The story is all over the place there is no overarcing narrative. Styx's goals change constantly from mission to mission, and the ending is ridiculous and underwhelming. The last level is lazy and terribly designed(it's easy to die before the first checkpoint and you have to reload the whole level, instead of having a checkpoint right at the start)Also I don't understand the extensive amount of 4th wall breaking. I get that Deadpool came out in 2016, and it was the current hip thing to do, but it really doesn't fit in this game, and it only makes it cringe along the corny jokes.You will face a lot of bugs during your gameplay, but none of them are gamebreaking though, just midly annoying.Overall I don't recommend it but you can definitely have some casual fun with it.",negative

Styx: Shards of Darkness,"I am someone who has played and enjoyed most modern stealth games: Dishonored 1 & 2, Thief, Splinter Cells, Hitman, Deathloop, Ghost Recons, and even others like assassins creed, Deus Ex and others, I always enjoy taking it the stealthy way.I have started this game and put it back down so many times, that at this point I might give up. Most stealth games offer more than just tracking pathing and walking behind people. Whether its climbing (which this game tries a bit) to add verticality, story, atmosphere, world, abilities, creative areas, etc. This game just feels.... soulless. Which is unfortunate.I actually treated the first game in this series the same way. Felt it was nothing special, but as a stealth lover, i should at least give it a solid playthrough. The first game looped back in on itself, and rehashed areas. Thats where it lost me. I dont even remember where this title lost me haha. Other people say its easy, and it really and truly is. There is very little if any other mechanics other than killing people, hiding bodies, and very basic climbing.IDK, I even gave it a shot in multiplayer campaign, and it makes no difference at all. Maybe I'll finish it one day, but with so many quality games on Steam deserving a playthrough, I don't know when that day will come. Its not bad. Like a 6/10. But only buy this if you have already played all the other stealth games. Its not long or expensive, so go ahead. Just dont say I didnt warn you. Its nothing special.",negative
Styx: Shards of Darkness,"Terrible game play, controls are clunky, and story is lame. Feels like an old xbox 360 era game with fancy graphics",negative
Styx: Shards of Darkness,"I enjoyed first one more, this one levels kinda repetative. The death scene shouldn't been enabled by default, it makes me so mad until I knew there is an option to disable it. Nothing special.",negative
Styx: Shards of Darkness,"In my ongoing and likely futile effort to write a Steam review for every game in my library (#165 out of 555)... it's time for Styx: Shards of Darkness.Here's a game with a great premise... and horrible execution. I'd love to give the game a second chance, as by all accounts its exactly my kind of game, so I hope developer Cyanide Studio considers a remaster someday. This current version, though? Serious stability problems. Think four crashes in less than 20 minutes of play. I tried fiddling with some settings to no avail, and went through the usual troubleshooting steps, which proved equally futile. Oh well.",negative
Styx: Shards of Darkness,"can't say I disliked my time with this game but I also have a difficult time recommending this title over it's predecessor.they removed the engaging story, the challenging stealth gameplay with pretty graphics and coop that nobody asked for.I played through this game on the hardest difficulty and at times I wondered why the game seemed so easy. the only logical explanation would be that the devs shrunk the view cone of npcs which imo further trivializes the entire game.the stealth genre is slowly but surely dying and the styx series had the opportunity to take over that niche, nobody was catering to. instead the devs decided to blow their budget on things the community didn't ask for and which to this day don't function very well.",negative

But the part that keeps annoying me is the jank in controls where you can consistently attempt to jump up to a ledge above you and ricochet off some geometry and fall to your death. So you start from the last checkpoint, lose all the things you stole and have to get them back or just give up and bolt for the end goal.",negative
Styx: Shards of Darkness,"looks like it would be fun but has a really Clunky interface, hard to control the character, lost interest after the first play, haven't gone back, just did not progress felt too grindy, and that plus the horrid controls is a recipe for disaster, overall bad game, don't waste youe monies.",negative
Styx: Shards of Darkness,"This game is fun. The story is interesting and the gameplay is cool. However, in Mission 7, the game decides to crash every time I want to play. This is a known bug that many people have. So if you enjoy finishing games, don't buy this one.",negative
Styx: Shards of Darkness,"Itâs a red flag when a stealth game is built around invisibility and x-ray vision.Styx: Shards of Darkness tries to recreate classic stealth games. However, the devs also copied the godawful platforming and glitchy, arbitrary AI of retro games. Hiding in darkness isnât reliable, and the insta-fail missions are pretty freaking lame.Though itâs better than modern AAA stealth games, that bar is set pretty low. I wouldnât recommend this to non-stealth fans. And the fact is, Styx isnât nearly as refined as Thief: Deadly Shadows, which used dynamic lighting and sound cues better than any game to date, and has more realistic AI. If you really want dark fantasy with a wise-cracking stealth protagonist, play Deadly Shadows.Note: thereâs a key-rebinding bug where you might need to edit the ini file.",negative
Styx: Shards of Darkness,"Despite its flaws, I was still going to recommend this game to stealth fans. However, the ending is just such a kick in the mouth that I cant in good faith recommend an unfinished game.The game mechanics and level design or both fantastic and really give this game the variable it needed to stand out among other stealth games. That being said, there are a number of issues which lead to Styx being an underwhelming experience. I have listed this issues below in no particular order:1- The RPG elements of the skill tree make no sense to me. I think this game would be far better if they placed the usable items in the levels instead of crafting materials to make those items. It seems like they just put it in to be able to say their game has crafting elements even though they dont actually contribute to the game and actually takes away from the fun and engagement the game has to offer. There also isnt a whole lot of choice here as youll quickly end up getting every skill you would deem even remotely usable.2- Characters are lifeless and seem to be pulled straight out of a mediocre ps2 game. You will not like any of these characters because they have no development or character to like. They may as well have been cardboard cut outs.3- Stealth vs killing. The game encourages you to not kill people and to complete each mission without being seen. Makes sense in a stealth game and an aspect that I liked a lot. That being said, everything else about this game is just trying to get you to be a murder hobo. Why bother playing this game as a stealth game when you can just go in guns a blazing? There is a ""killing"" skill tree yet every other skill try is half full of skills improving your killing capabilities. Why bother having a skill tree dedicated to killing -especially knowing you are encouraging people to not kill- then fill up half of the remaining skill trees with kill skills??? Why not give me skill trees that give me more abilities to be a stealth character??4- The levels are well designed and engaging until half way through the game when they make you replay the 5 levels you just played for ""story reasons"". What a kick in the mouth from lazy game devs.5- speaking of lazy game devs, the story is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. Probably the worst story I have seen in a game like this which is a real shame because theres so much potential with the characters and setting. To illustrate what I mean all I need to do is tell you the story is left on a cliffhanger with character allegiances changing for no reasons and everything youve done or worked up to till the end is just dropped without a care in the world. I would have still recommended this game if it wasnt for this ending. Seriously, â¥â¥â¥â¥ these devs. As a matter of fact because of this, not only will I not recommend this game, I will never be purchasing or recommending anything by Cyanide Studio. Go â¥â¥â¥â¥ yourselves you lazy lazy lazy pieces of trash.Theres more issues with this game but any left are pretty minor compared to the issues I had above. Such a disappointment.",negative

Styx: Shards of Darkness,"I somehow liked Styx: Master of Shadows, but couldn't bring myself to finish this. They improved the controls (which was the common complaint in previous game), however what annoyed me too much are parts of the game where game doesn't tell you what it wants you to do or where to go. Level design is maze-like for me and and when I feel like being lost in a game, that instantly relegates the game to different category. What's annoying me about Styx series (not just this one but also previous one) is quite fantasy-like setting (I prefer reality based settings like Splinter Cell series), non-entertaining story and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ protagonist.This is not a bad game, but I would say mediocre.

Every other room/house has a small hole where just you as a goblin can fit through - what the heck? Why would Dark Elves build such a thing?Gameplay:Your options are limited.

Simply an outstanding piece of work that I enjoyed every moment (even when frustrated) and will remember fondly.",positive
Return of the Obra Dinn,"Lucas Pope has a style, and that style ismaking you actually perform the challenges in the gameinstead of modelling them. InPapers, Pleaseyou had to actually find discrepancies in documents; likewise, inObra Dinn, a mystery game that has you uncover the fates of many dead people aboard a tragedy-stricken ship, you don't get any sorts of ""Compare Clues"" button.In this game, if you want to compare clues, you have to actuallydoit.At the start ofObra Dinn, you are provided with the list of everyone who was aboard, a sketch of their faces, and a clock that lets you see the last memory of a corpse. Now it's up to you to cross-reference an incredible number of events, meticulously writing down everyone's cause of death whileâand this is the game's main challengeâassigning identities.Sure, some of them are relatively straightforward: there were two sets of siblings on the ship, and a couple of names are mentioned directly in the memories, and did you notice who was it that tasked you with unveiling the mystery in the first place? But straightforward identities are rare and far between, and in no time you'll find yourself having to distinguish between four rather identical Chinese seamen.Most cases of death are, to the contrary, straightforward, but sometimes you'll have to actuallythink hardand model the whole situation, like when someone goes MIA or is wounded way before they bleed to death.Does it all sound fun to you? Well, it bloody is. The game is brilliant at giving just enough clues to make you do educated guesses. You'll have to listen to accents, note the types of clothes, or who stands where on the sketches, or in which room a person is typically found. And I can't stress enough how awesome it is that there are no shortcuts, no gamisms, no buttons saying things like ""Determine X's Origin."" If you want to find a Polynesian of this ship, you'll have to actually turn your brain on andthinkwhich of them looks Polynesian, like you would do in real life.No mystery game I've played has ever made me feel this close to being an actual detective.Even the good ones, likeAce Attorney, are mostly about guessing the creators' logic (""you won't leave this screen until you've clicked all the clues"").Obra Dinn, on the other hand, lets you looseâthus making all your findings feelyours, and yourself, smart.The music is, as expected, stunning. The visuals are unusual, but not random: this game is, to a large extent, about the recognition of faces and other distinctive features, which the pixellated visuals make both easier and harder.The only downside I can think of is that in the end,Obra Dinnis a bit too easy to brute force. Whenever you find a dead body and are sure about the nature of their death, you have zero reason not to try and assign an identity to itâany random oneâbecause you might happen to guess right. (Each time you write down three fates correctly, the game confirms them; after that, you can change the names of all other victims, since this also confirms they were wrong, and try the guesswork cycle again...)Then again, I guess it can't be helped, and it's up to the player not to detract from the fun by cheesing.Obra Dinnis a brilliant game and a strong contender for my GOTY 2018.P. S. And, unlike oh so many adventures, it takes some effort to make sure all ambiguous causes of death accept more than one answer, like when a person was thrown overboard by a beast, you can choose ""fell overboard"" or ""crushed by a beast"". So, no game logic stupidity here either.",positive
Return of the Obra Dinn,"""Why can't we have a normal, straightforward killing once in a while in this country!?"" - Ema SkyeReturn of the Obra Dinn is a detective game, in which you try to piece together the fates of sixty crew members aboard the titular ship. Using a morbid timepiece on a corpse, you can jump back to when the person was killed, and use the information present at the time of death to figure it out.In order to piece together a death, you need to identify the deceased, figure out the cause of death, and, if applicable, the perpetrator. One of the easier deaths to solve is an execution. The victim's name is shouted out, he is executed by firing line, and obviously shot through the heart... only you have to figure out who shot him. And four rifles fired at him.Such is the kind of detective game Return of the Obra Dinn is. Ruthlessly sparse in information, you can't rely on the stark obvious in order to deduce deaths. Verbal tics, background events, and crew relationships can lead to deduction to deduction, and sometimes you're simply left with process of elimination to figure out the rest of the identities. Not all information is present at the exact time of death as well. Cause of death and assailant tend to be easily found, but the actual identity of the victim could only be revealed in a completely unrelated flashback.Fortunately, the difficulty is purely logical, as the game is generous in not the amount of information presented to you, but how. Transcripts of words spoken are included with each death and note whether it's the deceased speaking or not, portraits are unblurred once the game knows it's given you enough information to make a deduction, and the game confirms your deductions in order to assuage your fear of a wrong deduction, but only once you have three correct, in order to prevent wild guessing. It's also well made in telling which crewmembers are present at which scenes. Sure, it may not tell you who the lad with the cap is in one scene, but it will tell you which one among them is the lad with the cap, that he was present at the execution scene, and that he was the one who died being torn apart by the kraken (assuming, of course, that you did indeed note that down).Because of this, Return of the Obra Dinn's difficulty is purely logical, and getting deaths confirmed is one of the most satisfying feelings in gaming. Despite the difficulty, though, I haven't once felt the need to reach for a walkthrough, due to how tidy the information presented to you is, as well as the game nudging me away if I don't have enough information to deduce, or if the deduction would be a particularly difficult one. Add to that the amazing one-bit aesthetic style, grand sound design, and a gripping story drip fed to you with each death you investigate, and you have one of the best games I've played.",positive
Return of the Obra Dinn,"100% worth the asking price. Took me about 9 hours to finish.It's the best detective game I've ever played.Do yourself a favor and don't use a walkthrough. Savor it. If a thick-head like me could finish it without it, you can too.",positive
Return of the Obra Dinn,"Ever fire up a game for the first time and within the first twenty or so minutes you know itâs got its hooks sunk into you? Return of the Obra Dinn had that effect on me, and that was only elevated by going into it mostly ignorant as to what the game is. The last thing I was expecting was a game to flex the parts of my brain involving deduction, logic and reasoning; parts I havenât used since the first Pheonix Wright game. I lost track of how many times Iâve had lightbulb epiphanies or gasped with a sudden realization, a kind of excitement I seldom encounter in gaming. Obra Dinn doesnât have a time limit, so meandering through the creaky ship at your own pace can be something of a relaxing experience - Though investigating a copious number of murders might shake those relaxed feelings.Iâd classify Return of the Obra Dinn as a nautical investigative story walker. The goal of the game is simple: A ship, the titular Obra Dinn, has returned from a voyage but is completely abandoned with apparent signs of foul play having taken place. Your characterâs job is to investigate what happened to the ship, its crew and cargo. This may sound dull, but once you arrive on the ship youâre quick to find out thereâs very little to go off of; a skeleton here, signs of a struggle thereâ¦ The game takes place in a time when commerce and trade by sea was at its peak under monarchy crowns, so thereâs no fingerprint dusting or CSI kits to be had here - Thatâs when the supplied compass comes into play. Using this apparently cursed/enchanted/mystical trinket, you can dip back in time when looking at a deceased person at the moment before/during when they died. Get your gumshoe hat on, because what occurs after is only the audio of the scene (voices, noises) followed by depositing you into the scene, though everything is at a stand still like a freeze frame. Using the previous sound clues and the locked-in-time environment around you, the task becomes finding out two whosâ and a how: Who is this person, who (or what, potentially) killed them, and how did they die?The Obra Dinn is a big ship and an accordingly big crew to go along with it. While some members are easily identified by audible hints and where they work/reside on the ship, others arenât so clear cut. Keeping track of the dozens of crew members isnât a daunting pain thanks to the handy log book at your disposal, separating each major development with the Obra Dinnâs voyage as chapters that can be revisited or reviewed. This is beneficial because each scene only lets you explore a very limited portion of the ship, so narrowing down who and what you can investigate keeps one from tripping over every bit of available information. Getting lost on the ship isnât a problem thanks to frequent backtracking and the supplied deck map, and even with the single toned color scheme of the graphics, everyone and everything can be clearly identified. In some cases where the scene has a lot of action going on, the graphical style can suffer a bit from visual pollution, but itâs not frequent enough to hamper your sleuthing.Entering one scene tends to open up the fate of another person, and it wonât be long until the Obra Dinn resembles one giant crime scene with how many bodies there are. The log book doesnât instantly indicate whether an assumption about a victimâs fate and their killer is correct or not, as getting âclumpsâ of people correct will get them permanently pasted into the book to show that youâre right. Out of the the dozens of people on the ship, I had to resort to a guide to identify at least four of them and I felt frustrated from how the game was stretching regarding their identifiable clues. Still, being able to get through approximately 70% of the game before getting slowed down by the trickier victims shows that the gameâs challenge curve is quite generous - If you know for what and where to look. I was genuinely excited whenever my newest guess would result in fanfare and correct confirmation without fail each and every time.Going blind into Return of the Obra Dinn, I had little to no idea what I was getting into, especially not a nautical investigation with more than the dangers of mutiny going on. My biggest issue past my slight ire with the late game is with how disappointingly limp of a note the game ends on. One chapter in the log book remains locked until every other possible person is accounted for, and this last chapter only confirms what you mightâve already assumed happened that led to the later climax. As mentioned earlier, it got its hooks into me since during my breaks between playing, I was still thinking about theories and potential guesses for what happened to some of those sailors. Return of the Obra Dinn gets a big recommendation from me if youâre looking for a game thatâs slower paced or will stoke the interest of the detective in all of us... Just bear in mind that thereâs backtracking out the neck if your patience is rattled by that.",positive

Return of the Obra Dinn,"I usually make it policy to complete a game before reviewing it but for Return to the Obra Dinn I have to make an exception.  This is an investigation game that mixes elements of board games such as Clue(do) and Mysterium with a bit of old school Commodore 64 graphics and the result is an absolute joy to the eyes, ears and mind overall.  Explore a ship and piece together the grisly fates of all 60 souls on board._________________________________PROS+ Amazing soundtrack.  The score is top notch and features some creepy cello and violin work right down to the swashbuckling more uptempo stuff.+ Visually intiguing.  Yes the style is old school retro but the limited time you have to pick through a death scene has a great amount of detail for you to take in.  The stills that you can move around inside like bullet time and try to piece together the mystery are sometimes bare but more often filled with detail.+ Great voice work. The voice work is on point.  The Scottish people sound Scottish, the Irish sound Irish, the Danes sound Danish etc and this even helps you to solve some of the murders if you have an ear for languages.+ Well planned writing and story.  For a puzzle game I find you need to be able to trust the developer to have covered all bases and that the logic is watertight.  Return to the Obra Dinn is hard and you may even find that you are doubting it makes sense but as you wade through the murky waters thing do start to become clearer.__________________________CONS- The tutorial needs more work.  It only pops up when you click on certain things and I went through 3 hours of the game not really understanding anything that I should have been doing but just being absorbed in the story.  A great time but I had to restart to focus my efforts.- You aren't really told about the differences between the black watch, smoke watch, regular watch and kind of have to make up your own story with regards to that.  (maybe this is explained in the end)__________________________________Wow.  Return to the Obra Dinn is Lucas Pope smashing another title out of the park.

Return of the Obra Dinn,"I often find that puzzle games are either trivial object matching (blue key opens the blue door, etc.) or infuriating, illogical Rube Goldberg machines that are totally out of place in the scenario. The puzzle aspects stand out from the setting and story, clearly existing only to give the player something to do.Return of the Obra Dinn is not like this. You start with a couple of easier scenarios to give an idea of how to play the game, but the difficulty quickly ramps up. Soon you are exploring your surroundings and analysing every snippet of information you have; accents, uniforms, locations on the ship, who the crew are interacting with, even who isn't present in a given situation.  You don't ""scan"" information out of anything, its up to you how you interpret what you see and hear in each scenario. This can often generate false leads, because the game hasn't pushed you to do any of this, it just gives you the scenarios and lets you actually play the investigator. But that makes it all the more interesting and rewarding when you actually solve some of those particularly tricky fates.The musical score, voice acting and art help to generate a level of immersion and emotional investment I have rarely experienced in games. Given the simplicity of the art style, this is all the more impressive.The game has a few minor issues; every now and again I couldn't quite tell what was going on due to the monochrome presentation for example, but they really don't detract from the experience significantly.I don't usually write reviews, but games like this remind me what the medium is capable of, and surely that's something worth advocating.",positive

Return of the Obra Dinn,"It is very difficult to think of any other game that is compelling, engrossing, and rewarding in the same ways asReturn of the Obra Dinn. Put simply, the game is a masterpiece. It is also a shining example of the versatility of the medium of video games and serves as a reminder of the myriad of ways in which games can be entertaining.Developed by Lucas Pope (ofPapers, Pleasefame),Return of the Obra Dinnplaces the player in the role of an early 19th Century insurance adjuster tasked with investigating the titular ship, which has returned to British waters after being missing for several years. Once on deck, the player finds there is not a single living soul on board...but must still determine what happened to all sixty of its crew members. Thankfully, the player has received gifts from an unknown benefactor: a book for cataloging the fates of the crew (complete with crew list and artist renditions of the crew members) and a pocket watch, the Memento Mortem. The latter of these items allows the player to examine the body of a dead crew member and be whisked backwards in time to the exact moment of their death. This, and the playerâs own investigative abilities, are all that is given to deduce what happened to the crew of theObra Dinn.While identifying and determining the fates of sixty unknown crew members seems like a daunting task,Return of the Obra Dinnuses its impressive visual style and unique presentation to make the experience enjoyable and entertaining, without being any less challenging. The entire game itself is presented in 1-bit monochrome (akin to the ancient days of computers) and the deaths of crew members are presented as three-dimensional freeze-frames in which the player can wander about. This makes each fate an interactive diorama that allows for observations of everything that was going on in the moment, usually providing clues to crew membersâ identities and roles on the ship. Alongside this, some very well-executed voice-acting and delightful nautical music make every scene feel different and interesting, and really flesh out the atmosphere. Add on top of that a genuinely intriguing mystery and masterfully executed clue-dropping and it creates an incredible and creative âwhodunnitâ.Figuring out crew members and their fates is so delightful that by the end itâs a shame that the ship didnât have a larger crew. In no way does the game hide information in a way that is unfair and, as long as the player pays close attention, figuring out what happened to the crew is never really truly frustrating. This is probably what makes it such an excellent experience; the core of the game is balanced absolutely perfectly. The retro presentation, sound design, and other aesthetics are an added bonus, like beautiful, tasty decorations on an even more exquisite, delicious cake.As with most delicious things, though, one is often left wanting more, which brings us to the only real downside ofReturn of the Obra Dinn: the player can only really experience once. After all crew is identified and their fates determined, thereâs not really much else that can be done. That being said, it is a fantastic experience without rival.Return of the Obra Dinnhas very easily secured its place as one of my very favorite games of all time. From concept to presentation to execution it is truly fantastic package and one that I heartily recommend. Much like theObra Dinnitself there is nothing else quite like it and it is most definitely worth investigating.",positive

Return of the Obra Dinn,"Return of the Obra Dinn is Lucas Popeâs, the creator of Papers Please, new game. I respected Papers Please but I bounced off it halfway through because I found it to be a combination of tedious and hectic that I didnât gel with. Obra Dinn is much more my style and is a great adventure game.At its core Obra Dinn is a detective game similar to Tacoma, but with much more of a logical deductive bent that demands you solve these mysteries to progress instead of Tacoma, which was a more casual approach. You explore the Obra Dinn and when you locate a body you use the watch to transport yourself to right at the time of that personâs death. You are then able to explore these grisly tableaus to find any pertinent information that you can decipher that can help identity people and their cause of death. The game is extremely good at giving you the information you need to figure out who is who through multiple means such as dialogue, drawings, and just exploring the environment to discover clues. You use the journal to consolidate your information and finalize your findings. The journal is a strongly organized tool that gives you a good deal of info that you learned without having to go back and replay flashbacks constantly, i.e. it gives you a transcript of any dialogue in a scene and tells you who was in a scene, the journal drawings of the passengers and crew are also an extremely valuable asset. You still have to go back and do memories to locate environmental clues, but the journal really streamlines and modernizes the process. The game will only tell you if you successfully guessed the identity of a person as well how they died if you did it successfully for three people at a time, a way to prevent you from just brute forcing the game through trial and error. I admit I did do some educated guessing in order to complete some entries because I missed some clues, but as I said the game does give you the clues so you donât really have to do this, the game does not cheat in the slightest.Obra Dinnâs writing is overall quite good. The mysteries of the plot are engaging and ultimately interesting. The only weak part is that there isnât much in the way of strong characterization. There are aspects of the crew and passengersâ characters you must recognize such as friendships, personal possessions, and a few quirks, ultimately though the cast arenât really explored or developed at all compared to Tacoma. Thatâs not a really a knock against the game, because the mystery and uncovering it is clearly the focus, but just donât go expecting to get attached to anyone like you would in say Fullbrightâs games or Edith Finch. There is a special final chapter unlocked if you solve as much of the journal as you can before you leave the ship. Donât expect any major revelations, it acts as more of a bookend epilogue as you find out the fates of two crew members that you couldnât solve before. The game has voice-acting and its overall competent, nothing standout, but the VAs do the job.Now youâve probably noticed the gameâs got this old timey monochromatic PC aesthetic going on. The game gives you several options for the old OS graphics of your choices, the default is an old Mac while you can also make it look like a Commodore or an IBM among other options. I went with the default Mac and I liked how the game looks, it really fit the feel of the game and it was clearly detailed enough where I never felt I was scratching my head figuring out what was going on. The Obra Dinn itself is a really well realized setting and it reminds me of the attention to detail that Herald had it when it came to bringing an old sailing ship to life. One thing that could be considered a gameplay flaw is that you have to manually go over to a corpse on the ship to go the corresponding flashback if you want to revisit it. Tying this in with the setting and atmosphere though I didnât mind this aspect because it made you learn the setting more and give a sense of the space. The sound design is very strong as well, the music exudes a mysterious, nautical vibe. I especially like some of the bombastic tracks that play in the one chapter where you find out about the event that took out a good chunk of the crew, it really sells the danger and power of the scenes.Obra Dinn is a great detective game and I highly recommend it if that kind of game is in your wheelhouse. Itâs a smartly designed game that doesnât cheat you in anyway and makes you take in the game world in a truly engaging way.",positive
Return of the Obra Dinn,"If you have any doubt whatsoever let me assure you: Return of the Obra Dinn is an absolute masterpiece.. This game is the very antithesis of AAA-games and it bloody well shows. By combining unforgettable story telling, masterful execution of gameplay and a simple yet pleasing aesthetic Obra Dinn is as evocative as it is profound. Simply put: this might be the best deduction game out there and is well worth the full price if not else to support Lucas Pope's furthering of gaming as a medium.The game takes place on the derelict ship Obra Dinn that has returned to English waters after it went missing with all its crew. It is up to you, the player, an insurance inspector of rank to row out to the ship and find out the fate of the ship and its crew. To assist you in this rather gruesome task is a peculiar logbook and a supernatural clock that lets you relive the last moment of an individual's life. This is all I need to say and honestly all you should know. Obra Dinn is a game that you sadly can only experience once and I implore you to go into it blind and do your best to piece the story together one act at a time.The visuals are striking, the atmosphere spot on and the music and sound production stellar. The gameplay is intuitive and really rewards exploration and cleverness to the point where you just giggle in delight when you get another set of cleverly deducted fates correct. Honestly this is one of those once in a lifetime games that I want to shout from the rooftops about and if you have not yet experienced it, you lucky bastard..Get it! Buy it at a high price and support this superb gamemaker. Once again Lucas Popes proves to the world that the myth of the auteur is not dead and I can't wait to see what he conjures next..",positive
Return of the Obra Dinn,"Return of the Obra Dinnis nothing short of a masterpiece.This is easily one of the most brilliant titles I've played this year. The artstyle is magical. The music and voice acting is outstanding. The story is beyond intriguing. The puzzle aspect is so perfectly crafted. And icing on the cake is that it runs on a toaster and controller support is great.Seriously folks, every little detail in this is impressive.Lucas Pope is a force to be reckoned with, and has clearly shown us they are no one-hit wonder.Return of the Obra Dinnplays like a juicy, magical, indie version ofMyst. It's not exactly that, but it's in the same ballpark.Look, I'm going to give you zero details about the game - read nothing and jump in.This is a must-own for anyone that likes story-driven puzzle games, or frankly, just indie games in general.",positive
Return of the Obra Dinn,"Lucas Pope has done it again and managed to turn a mundane task of insurance investigation into an innovative, riveting storytelling. Your goal is to correctly deduce the names and fate of each individual crew members of Obra Dinn. You do this by walking through flashbacks one after another, unraveling the tragic tale of Obra Dinn along the way. The game does not hold hands with the players. There are a lot of missing information as one would expect from flashbacks. You will have to deduce some names based on the individual's race, nationality, age, dress, and position. The game will let you know when you are correct in a group of 3 so that there is a balance of requiring deduction and having to do some guess work. While the game has no reply value whatsoever, the experience is truly unique, the one that can only be felt through video games. If you love crossword puzzles and a good seafaring adventure story, then this game is perfect for you.",positive
Return of the Obra Dinn,"This game is best enjoyed with a glass of whiskey and a close friend.Take your time, talk to each other. Make notes. Inspect the wax museum of long-dead sailors and piece together the truth of what happened. Of who died and how.Nothing is more satisfying than lingering on a gunshot, or asking your mate if they remember who has the Russian accent, and then, together, agreeing on the result. And being wrong.Can you play this by yourself? Definitely, and do that if you want. But it's very rare a game lets you play at your own pace. No rushing, no skill tests, no miss-able items. This opens Obra Dinn up to being a delightful experience for a small group to enjoy, and that's how I recommend playing it.(Drink responsibly and legally.)",positive

Return of the Obra Dinn,"Return of the Obra Dinn is a detective puzzle game which actually relies on you to make conclusions of your own.Your job is to establish the fates of 60 people who either died or went missing from the titular Obra Dinn merchant ship. Naturally, there're no live witnesses to question and most of the bodies are either gone or have withered away to bare bones. The only way you can learn anything is through a magic pocket watch that can show you the demise of somebody whose remains you've found: you'll also hear some events right before their death, including speech, environmental noises and gut-wrenching squishes of injuries and flesh torn apart; then you're free to walk around the still scene of the person's death, taking whatever notes you can get before proceeding to the next scene.Up until now it sounds like a typical detective game. What makes Obra Dinn stand out? Decisions. Specifically the fact that decisions in this game are completely yours, not the protagonist's. While in a generic detective game you just search for some token evidence to progress and help the protagonist draw a conclusion, in Obra Dinn, everything is up to you, the player: ""Who?"", ""When?"", ""Why?"" and ""How?"" are the questions that only you can answer, for every soul on the ship. Consequently, you can also decide to ignore these questions completely.Usually, in a game with realistic setting, no protagonist has anything similar to magic watch you have in Obra Dinn. So, you may think you're a little bit overpowered at first. Soon after investigation starts, though, you'll see that this watch is just a tool. And while it is of a great aid, it won't connect any dots or make any answers for you. And you need to connect dots and get answers.Sure, the magic watch can show you, for example, a man looking like a sailor getting shot in the face with a blunderbuss. Alright, was he really a sailor? What was his job? What was his name? What has he done to get shot? Who shot him? Why? Although the game does not require you to answer the last question, it's an important clue that would help you to nail down what's happening. You don't have a pre-generated set of clues to collect and questions to ask to make progress (or, as it usually happens, for your character to make a conclusion and push the game forward). In fact, you're free to breeze through the scenes, half-assedly get a couple of the fates correctly and bail out of the ship, just like a real cop would.To actually put every piece of this puzzle together, you'll need to pay immense attention to every scene. To your aid, you have that watch, your notebook, the ship's ledger, and three pictures. Closely inspect all of the people present in the scene, who are luckily marked in your investigation book. You're free to make assumptions about their identity based on their clothing, location in the ship, their actions, their speech, even their place in the group pictures - just about anything, really. The game does not tell you what exactly is important. Some of your assumptions will inevitably be wrong, and the only way to verify them is to write down your conclusion into the book and see if it's accepted. The book will tell you when you get three fates correct, and it will also tell you when you have enough info to reliably identify someone based on the scenes you've already seen. Of course, the ""three fates correct"" mechanic gives you a way to brute force some stuff, especially with several people of the same ethnicity or background. However, try not to resort to bruteforcing - there's a way to legitimately identify everyone using more sublte clues. And you'll feel proud of yourself discovering them.As the clues are mostly visual, it's time to notice the elephant in the room - the graphics. The game does an amazing job in post-processing - while you'll notice that some facial textures and character models certainly lack fine details, the effects make them pretty palatable. Dithering works extremely smooth and you can easily distinguish shapes, faces, details and even smaller objects. The only misleading things are rare shining or highlighted objects, especially when they're being used as murder weapons - pay extra attention to those.I've mistaken one stabbing for a strangulation because of that.Whatever the game lacks in visual presentation, it makes up double for it in sound design and music. A lot of love went into recording the sound for the death scenes: the voice acting is pretty good, there's a lot of convincing noises, and most importantly the audio scenes feel lively and eventful, but not cluttered. You can always count that the important stuff, however subtle it may be, will be subtle just enough to still be noticed. This is rather nice, because it's not that convenient to replay the audio of the scene again. And don't worry if you're not very strong in foreign languages - the game will translate them for you and write them down to investigation book, you'll just have to guess the language. Though language is a vague clue, combined with all the others it can help you nail down some of the fates.The music is just the icing on the cake. Each chapter of the ship's fate has its own motif and several tracks recorded around it. The choice of instruments and melodies that evoke a vague ""age of sail"" feeling is spot-on, as is the choice of motifs in setting the mood of the chapter. You'll definitely remember some of the tracks even after finishing the game.According to the Steamspy's estimations, The Return of the Obra Dinn has recently just barely scaled 100k sales. This is a game too unique in gameplay to pass on, and I wholeheartedly recommend buying it.P.S. For more awesome hidden gems, follow theCRIMINALLY Low Salessteam curator.",positive

This is gaming.",positive
Return of the Obra Dinn,"Return of the Obra Dinn is so superior to its predecessors in the Detective subgenre that it's frankly embarrassing. I'd grown so accustomed to Detective games guiding me to every answer that I'd forgot that the whole magic of these type of games is supposed to be in deducing the mystery for myself. You know the old gameplay formula: click around to add objects into your inventory, pick between a set of multiple choices in dialogue, and move from scene to scene as the main character slowly unravels the story as you sit there and enjoy the ride. You're not Sherlock; hell you're barely Watson. And you know what, some of those games have good enough stories that we can forgive it. But Obra Dinn shows us it can be done different. It can be done better.In Return of the Obra Dinn, the main character never speaks. If you can't figure it out, no one is going to bail you out with a line of dialogue that practically solves the whole thing for you. With exception, you can't really brute force or guess your way to a solution either: I suppose it's still technically multiple choice but instead of 3 or 4 options per choice, it's more like hundreds. And even if you magically land on the right choice by guessing, you have to get 2 more choices correct before being told if your initial guess was right. It's as close to ""fill in the blank with the right answer"" as we've ever gotten with these type of games. You actually have to know the answer to every little mystery. And it's glorious.Return of the Obra Dinn is a great example of a developer having a vision and faithfully executing on it. And maybe that was why I was left with such a lasting respect for Lucas Pope after my experience. The attention to detail is beyond what I thought was possible for a solo developer. I happen to know a bit about boats, so to see just how accurate and well-researched the depiction is...needless to say it's impressive. But what threw me overboard (ha!) was when I noticed that the voices and writing for the Chinese and Formosan dialogue was distinct from one another, and accurate both historically and regionally. The Formosans spoke in traditional Taiwanese, as they would have in the early 19th century. He didn't have to do that. The Formosans could have spoken in modern Mandarin and even players who knew Mandarin wouldn't have cared. This sort of stuff echoes throughout the game, bit by bit adding to the quality of the experience. Oh and by the way this madman composed the excellent music himself too. The art? Yeah, that's him too. What the hell bro.But let's take a moment to talk about the art direction. 1 bit was a bold choice, but one which fits the game perfectly. I love the homage to the early days of personal computing; you can even go in the settings to add a filter which emulates what it'd be like to play on 5 different types of old school monitors. Cute.I have a handful of things I could nitpick (I'd have liked a fast travel system to individual memories, a note system might have helped, and I think the initial presentation of ""what you're supposed to do"" could have been better) but they're really minor and overall, the game expertly does what it needs to do. There is definitely a small hump you have to get over where you feel overwhelmed with information, but that doesn't take long to shake. And hoo boy, figuring things out felt sooo good. I did a little pop off every time I got 3 fates correct. Super rewarding gameplay loop.What a game. Damn near flawless, and an excellent use of my time.",positive
Return of the Obra Dinn,"Return of the Obra Dinn makes me want to deeply hate Lucas Pope for his brilliance as a creator, but the guy is such a damn good developer that all I can do is fall in love again with his work. This is, without a question, the most unique, engaging, innovative and memorable indie game I have played since the modern concept of âindie gameâ was invented.In RotOD, you play as an investigator in charge of uncovering the fate of a derelict ship that went missing along with its passengers and crewmembers. To help you with your task, youâre given a magic compass that, when faced to a dead body, takes you back to a sort of life-sized diorama of the exact moment in which they died, and it is up to you to find out the cause of their death as well as their names.This is not an easy task, as the evidence is not always clear or even at all visible, which will force you to thoroughly analyze the context and use your intuition to fill in the blanks by frequently replaying many scenes after gaining some new knowledge about certain characters or actions in a different diorama that will shed a new light to already visited events.Also, since we as the players are the ones fully in charge of the investigation, the full picture will always unveil at our own pace, which means that the game will stretch as far as we want. Fortunately, Pope never uses cheap tricks to make the story progress artificially so we can take our time to investigate, think and replay sections for as long as necessary, and if we are still not able to solve some deaths, they will remain unsolved as we werenât clever enough to put all the pieces together. This makes Obra Dinn the definitive detective game: there is a mystery to solve and itâs only up to us to uncover all of its secrets.The artstyle is one of a kind and even if you are not nostalgic of the era it emulates it still feels totally mesmerizing and enigmatic while youâre playing. It manages to act both as a homage to ancient computer games and as an essential gameplay mechanic, by carefully hiding clues and information and forcing you to guess and analyze every scene over and over until you fully solve it. The audio is equally stunning, the sound design here is top notch and acts as an essential piece of puzzle solving while not giving away too much at the same time, and it is crafted in a way that really puts us into the gameâs world, with very powerful yet subtle sound effects that build a believable environment for us to investigate in. The soundtrack has some outstanding pieces as well that play during our investigation and perfectly capture the âsailorâs lifeâ theme, completing the gameâs creative direction flawlessly.All in all, Return of the Obra Dinn is a truly innovative experience that has no equal, a game thatâs masterfully designed and built with an obsessive degree of love and attention to detail and a sensational audiovisual presentation. We will be talking about this game for years to come and the entire industry should pay attention to this kind of projects if we are to help videogames as a whole mature and evolve.Ahoy!",positive

Return of the Obra Dinn,"What can I say that hasn't already been said? This is easily one of the most memorable games I've ever played, one of the most unique experiences of a life wasted playing video games. If I could, I'd erase my memory of it to experience it all over again.Obra Dinn is a retro-styled detective game that looks like a still image from an old Macintosh program come to life. You are an insurance adjustor, sent to the good ship Obra Dinn, which has just been found after being lost at sea for years. Your job is to find out what happened to the crew - all of whom are missing. You start with a few corpses on the main deck and go backward from there, each death leading you to a new clue. The story is told largely in reverse, and never what you expect.If I have any cons, it would be that, yes, occasionally it's a bit easier to make some wild guesses about crew members and hope you're correct. It's occasionally quite hard. But in the end, I never remembered any of that, instead I remembered the way the story unfolds, the visuals, the music. It's all wrapped up in a nice little grey-and-green package that I would like to keep near me forever.",positive
Return of the Obra Dinn,"Return of the Obra Dinn is an exceptional narrative experience. You are an investigator who has to find out what has happened to the missing crew in the ship. Your only tools are a diary which will offer some basic information like the names and roles of the crew, a special pocket watch and your wits.Looking around the ship can give the impression that it will not take long to solve all the misteries aboard, it's a small ship after all. The truth, however, is that it will take all your deductive and reasoning skills to the limit to find the fates of everybody aboard the Obra Dinn. Here is when the game shines the brightest, you need to create theories, establish relationships with vague clues and little details present in the different scenes you will observe. There is a jingle that plays when you have guessed correctly the fate of 3 people, it fills you with joy and the push to continue forward, such a great feeling.I truly recommend to play with more people, you can discuss the different clues and leads of each person. You will need all the help you can get to crack this case open. Different perspectives are invaluable in a game like this.Obra Dinn is a masterpiece, this type is narrative is so engaging that I was a little sad when the end of the game was getting near, once you get into the pace of the game you will be sucked in.",positive
Return of the Obra Dinn,"The moment i booted up the game i was hooked on the rather bizzare premise of this title to the point that i forgot to eat, sleep or go to the loo for the duration of this game. The only time i got from my pc was when the ending credits rolled. This is quite possibly the best game i have played this generation in terms of innovation.Here you play as an insurance agent investigating the fate of the people on board the ship named Obra Dinn which went missing a few years back  along with its passengers and crew. It has finally been found and its your job to find out the fate which befell each of the people onboard the ship. The game gives you a magic compass which on pointed to a body  takes you back to a still flashback of the exact moment that person died. You have to find out using this mechanic as well as your own powers of deduction the cause of each member's death. The game never outright tells you any of the characters names except in the very first flashback which acts as a kind of tutorial making you look for the various ingenious clues  hidden in each of the flashbacks as well as the ones present in the ship itself. The game never tells you straight away when you complete a particular person's fate, it only confirms your findings when you have correctly deduced the fates of 3 members of the ship which is actually brilliant as it makes it very difficult for the player to brute force his way through the game.The artstyle is really refreshing as i have never seen something feel so mystifying and beautiful at the same time. The artstyle perfectly compliments the games's mechanics giving off a cathartic feeling to the player . You would be surprised by how much information it conveys even though it is so low detailed but at the same time acts as a gameplay mechanic carefully hiding the obvious answers and makes the player come up with his/her own assumptions. The music in the game expertly integrated that it becomes the perfect accompaniment to the games mechanic as it has various themes for each of types of clues you will find in the game making it even more exciting to figure out the various mysteries involving series of unfortunate events that took place on the ship.Lucas Pope is truly a genius in creating such a masterpiece in detective game genre which has definitely established a new standard in innovation and will influence the future games in the genre. I also recommend his previous game ""Papers Please"" as well and myself am eagerly awaiting his next title.",positive

Return of the Obra Dinn,"When Obra Dinn first came out, the single color graphics were a not appealing to me so I did not purchase it. Recently, a fellow Steam gamer (who I have great respect for) highly recommended it so I thought I'd give it a try. Almost 40 hours later, I can only say 'WOW!'  The game was designed and developed by one guy (Lucas Pope).  I marvel at his creativity and his ability to tell a great story within a very unique exploration/puzzle framework.Obra Dinn is one of the best games I've played in a long time. The task is to investigate a ship who disappeared with all hands and then reappeared, empty. Your job is to determine the fate of each of 60 crew and passengers. Your tools are a notebook and a pocket watch that allows you to experience the last memory of each soul. This is done through a series of short vignettes about the fate of each person and the activities of all others in the vicinity. You listen to snippets of dialog and carefully observe each scene. You then attempt to match each face to a name and identify what happened to that person. The story begins at the end, with the last man standing, and then steps backwards to incrementally explain the ships timeline.Sounds easy? Think again. You use your listening skills and powers of observation. You must deduce answers from hints/facts that are sometimes clearly presented and, at other times, very subtle. It is a fascinating exercise and, as the story unfolded, I became totally captivated. It is a grand adventure on the sea, complete with magic, sea beasts, treachery, greed, bravery, etc.My only caveat is that it is a difficult game to initially figure out how to play. There is actually a good bit of instruction provided but you have to understand the framework and the mechanics of the pocket watch to make sense of things.  I stumbled about for awhile before finding the rhythm of the game. Once I understood the mechanics, I restarted a new game and began to make my way through the chapters with a precise approach. If you start playing and get frustrated, I would strongly encourage you to tough it out and perhaps check the discussion boards for assistance with gameplay. I would not recommend going anywhere near a posting with spoilers, as the joy of discovery (without cheating) is something you will not want to miss. There is a .PDF posted on the discussion board that has the crew picture from the Obra Dinn journal, with a code assigned to each person. Since you are keeping up with 60 people, printing this picture for reference is very helpful (as is taking copious notes).The mechanics are simple, with only a few keys used to navigate the ship and peruse/update the journal.  The sound track is a key element of the game so headphones are a must.My only regret is that it is not a game I can replay and experience it all for the first time again!",positive

Return of the Obra Dinn,"The creator of ""Papers, Please"" is back with another game that takes a mundane job and makes it extraordinaryEarly in the morning fog a ghost ship appears on the horizon, the unmanned vessel slowly bobbing closer and closer. Upon further inspection it is revealed to be the Obra Dinn, an East India Company ship which mysteriously went missing in 1802, about five years prior. As the insurance adjuster assigned to this case, it is your duty to explore this ship and determine the fates of the 60 crew and passengers who are now either dead or missing. This is a task which requires careful exploration, paying close attention to everything you see and hear, as well as the use of deductive reasoning.GameplayIn order to successfully complete your job you must put a name to every face on the ship as well as outline exactly what befell them, both in terms of who (or what) killed them and how, or exactly where they currently are if they are alive. You are aided by a magical pocket watch which, upon discovering a body, will trigger a flashback which allows you a frozen snapshot of what was occurring at the time of death. Using this, as well as the shipâs manifest, you will be able to comb the ship discovering bodies and slowly piecing together exactly what occurred on the ill-fated Obra Dinn.StoryI am going to avoid saying anything more about the storyline, as this is really the driving force behind the gameplay as you must piece everything together to unlock the full story of what occured. I highly recommend that anyone interested in this game avoid watching any gameplay videos or reading too much about it as this could easily spoil important aspects. This is a game best experienced firsthand and knowing as little as possible. I went into it knowing only what I previously outlined here and I found the story to be extremely intriguing and the process of identifying what occurred on my own to be immensely satisfying.SoundsOverall this is one of the most impressive sounding games Iâve ever played. The foley work is absolutely stunning, providing sound effects that are so convincing that they manage to be disturbing at times. The voice acting is also very well done, with solid performances all across the board. It helps that most of the voice actors are actually from the same country as their respective characters, something which allows the various nationalities to actually sound as they should. This not only makes the game so much more immersive but actually can help you in determining some identities. Last but not least is the soundtrack, which is beautifully done and fits well with the tone of the game.Retro GraphicsThe game uses an art style modeled after early Macintosh games. I found this to be a unique touch that paired very well with the eerie and supernatural themes of the game.My VerdictI loved every minute I spent in this game and completing it was a bittersweet moment as I enjoyed it so much that I was sad to see it end. To me this is the mark of a truly incredible game, and for this reason it is one I strongly recommend.",positive

Return of the Obra Dinn,"Games that tell stories only capable of being relayed through the medium of gaming will always hold a special place in my heart. Since my first encounters with video games as a whole, I've never quite found any method of storytelling to even compare to it. Sure, the occasional film or manga or what have you might catch my attention, but those I hold at the peak of any other medium don't really come close to the experiences I've had with gaming.Return of the Obra Dinn has once again solidified this idea for me, and it does so in such a way where I feel that everything within the experience is deserving of commendation. The actors, writing, art, music, and everything all together unite for an extremely fleshed out and cohesive experience that held my attention the whole way through. I believe this holds true for much of the game's playerbase due to the incredible completion rates seen on each of the achievements. Return of the Obra Dinn manages to create a very unique gameplay loop I haven't quite seen elsewhere, it's an incredibly fresh and engaging experience that I feel anyone with a brain could hold appreciation for. It might not be a grand story in comparison to other titles of today, but it sure as hell is a good one, a GREAT one.A game that will constantly have you thinking, theorizing, trying new things, finding new angles, and most importantly, keeping you engaged following through its bizarre and beautiful storytelling. This is a game that I believe couldn't and shouldn't be passed up, if you're interested, play it. You won't regret it.",positive
Return of the Obra Dinn,"Return of the Obra Dinn is a truly indie masterpiece. While having very primitive graphics and simple gameplay, it is still able to provide you great mysterious story, making you eager to solve this investigation.Pros:+ Strongly built story with dozens of characters connected with each other+ Monochrome visuals only increase the overall mysterious vibes+ Investigation process is simply amazing+ Freeze scenes look brilliant, especially in this minimalistic style+ Sound effects play on your nerves effectively to emphasize the disturbing atmosphereCons:- That unique visual style doesnât always work well - sometimes you canât even understand what the heck is going on on the picture, that can lead to some misunderstanding identifying the reason of someoneâs deathItâs been quite a while since I played a really great and quality indie project and now itâs about time. This season pleased us with lots of different indie gems, but hand down, Return of the Obra Dinn is the best here. It immerses us in a special atmosphere before even starting. We hear bursts of waves, hoarse voice of a boatman and completely opposite aristocratic voice of our protagonist, who know for sure why he is here and what is his mission.And then we see a ship. By the moment we step on it, we hear the sound of creaky wooden deck and these sounds awaken the spirit of adventure inside of our heart. However, in this case, this adventure has finished loooong time ago and our mission is to investigate what the hell went wrong here.StoryItâs XIX century. Inspector of the East India Company heading off to the ghost ship named Obra Dinn, that has been counted as lost for a while. Now it was found, but the whole crew has gone missing mysteriously and nobody can understand what went wrong with those poor sixty people onboard. And you are the only one who can solve this mystery and identify ever missing person on the ship.GameplayGameplay here is extremely uncomplicated. Inspector moves around the ship and looks for corpses scattered around the ship. When he stays near one of it, he takes a special magic watches, that allows you to see the last minutes of the dead manâs life. After clicking the button, you hear a tragic music, see arrows running around the clock face and the screen is getting darker.First you hear sounds on the dark screen, the last thing dead man heard before he died. It can be someoneâs dialogue, sound of the gun shot, punch, scream - something that informs you that a really bad thing happened in there. Then the dark screen goes away and player turns out in such kind of a static freeze scene, where he can move freely, look at the peopleâs faces, trying figure out what the heck happened here.Investigator has a special book, where each body is assigned with two pages. First one is a dossier of the guy, where you have to choose his name, cause of death and the one, who killed him and a text version of the previously heard dialogue. The second page shows us the location of the body and a big illustration, that shows us all the people, which has been attended at the moment of death there.This book also has a list of the whole crew, that tells us his name, occupation and nationality. Also, there are a map of the ship and few illustration of the crew, made by an artist, who lived on the Obra Dinn. All these documents accompanied by magic watch will be the only tools that will help you during your investigation.So, after seeing the scene and using these tools we have to identify the identity of the victim, cause of death and the murderer. But the trick is that usually itâs not able to do straight away - seamen never call each other by name and very rarely give us a proper clue regarding this or another character. You donât have to fill every field the first moment you see it, just write down the info you are sure about for hundred percents and move to the next corpse. One way or another, sooner or later, you will be back to your previous victim with more information that will help you to identify it properly.Some of the passengers are related, so itâs easier to identify such characters. You always have to keep in mind, what you have seen before and this is one of the main issues of the Obra Dinn. It doesnât let you to play it portionally, enjoying it a bit here, and a bit there. Because, this way you can easily forget the minor detail, which could help you to identify something important. So the only efficient way to finish this game will be playing it one big session.Obviously, the easiest part of investigation is to define the death cause, because it is usually what we see on the image, his last memory, before he died. Sometimes it can be really obvious, other times it will make everything to confuse you by any means. But itâs way more difficult to identify the personality. You have to be very attentive here, check the position of the person before he died, listen to his language and accent, watch what he do in otherâs scenes, check his position on the illustration and which characters are the most involved in contacts with him.In some situations you canât identify the personality only because there is no information at all and all you have to do is to only guess. I had this really weird situation, when I knew everything except of the name of the guy. After closer look I identified that he looked like asian and was a sailor, so I checked the list and saw that it was only few asian guys and after sorting them all out - ring! - another three guessed fates.Yes, that is correct, you will not be notified after correctly guessing every time you choose your characterâs fate. Instead, you will have to guess three guys and then you will hear that magic music and feel that satisfaction after seeing this cutscene showing the guys you identified. After adding them to the list of the correct guys, you will notice that even the font changed from handwritten to typed one.GraphicsFirst, this decision of making this new game with 1-bit graphics looked like a joke, especially when a game requires you to search for something all the time and gaze into the details. But in terms of atmosphere these visuals work out in a great way. You know, this contrast two-colour image subconsciously binds with XIX century aesthetics. Plus, you can even choose from different color palettes in the options.AudioNo doubts here, music is also memorable thing in game. These sounds that you hear after clicking the watches.. Oh God, itâs so dramatic, so damn tragic, that I wasnât able to play this game in the night, I felt goosebumps all over my skin. And the that violin play on the background when you guess the fates or important events - itâs captivating!ConclusionWell, Return of the Obra Dinn is definitely that game that will steal your heart if you are into investigating and detective games. Here you will break your brain, trying to guess all the fates and to understand what the heck is going on there. Based on my experience, I strongly recommend you to not make big intervals between playing it, because otherwise you risk to forget very important things there. Frankly speaking, I am still on my way to guess everyoneâs fate and to reveal the final chapter to see the whole story, so I will be back to my journey and I wish you all the best with yours!Enjoy!Follow my curator's page if you enjoy my reviews and want to stay tuned!",positive
Return of the Obra Dinn,he did it again. the absolute madman,positive
Return of the Obra Dinn,"I grew up with parents who read dozens of mystery books every year, but I never caught the bug. I donât *dislike* mystery novels, but the vast majorityâeven the acclaimed onesâare constrained and formulaic, and 99% of them are murder mysteries, as if life contained no other mysteries than âwho killed this guy?âLikewise, Iâm lukewarm on puzzle games; I can enjoy them, but solving a puzzle for its own sake really isnât enough for me; I need some sort of narrative grounding to drive me and keep me interested.So I wouldnât have seriously considered playing Return of the Obra Dinnâa murder mystery puzzle gameâ if it hadnât racked up numerous awards from writers I respect, and if it didnât come from Lucas Pope, developer of the extraordinary Papers, Please.Iâm glad I did. Obra Dinn is one of the most compelling games Iâve played in years; I couldnât put it down, and blew through it in a couple days. For those unfamiliar, Return of the Obra Dinn casts you as an insurance investigator sent to inspect a ship (the titular Obra Dinn) thatâs drifted in to port with nary a living soul aboard; just a few corpses, and dozens of crewmembers missing and unaccounted for.In short order, you get a magic trinket that allows you to witness the final moments of any corpse you find (about 15 seconds or so). You hear the dialog and sounds of the moments leading up to their death, and then can walk around a freeze-framed diorama of the scene at the moment of death. Using this ability, you need to find out what happened to each of the 51 crewmembers of the Obra Dinn.Why is Obra Dinn so captivating? First, it has a pointillistic art style unlike any other game Iâve ever played, and a limited color palette modeled after the original Macintoshâs display capabilities. While I initially found this a little off-putting (namely due to the aliasing), it turns out that the art style is perfectly fit for purpose, fully modeling every important detail of a scene without the textural complexity that can make it hard to pick out a specific object in a modern AAA game. The sound design belies the gameâs budget; every voice is perfectly cast, and the musicâhaunting, and using nautical elements like a shipâs bellâperfectly sets the tension of the increasingly terrible scenes youâll witness.The second is that this really blows up the confines of the murder mystery. Make no mistake; some people definitely get murdered, and you need to find not only the culprit, but the manner of the killing (ala Clue). But most crewâs fates are not so simple, and figuring out the myriad ways in which crewmembers died (or disappeared) using nothing but the evidence of your eyes and deductive reasoning initially seems nigh-impossible; and yet I completed all 51 with almost no hints, because the puzzles are just that tightly designed. This is a game that frequently makes you feel brilliant, and gives you some easier mysteries to solve, which helps eliminate possibilities as you approach the harder cases.If Obra Dinn has any failing, itâs that the plot is more in service to the texture, and the complex web of puzzles, than something that really stands up on its own; in hindsight, itâs a fairly generic tale of Bad Things Happen At Sea. But thatâs not the point; Obra Dinn isnât a mystery novel, itâs something that is (to me) infinitely more fun. Itâs such a work of singular genius and vision that I worry it wonât be easy to emulate.",positive
Return of the Obra Dinn,"Return of the Obra Dinn is one of the most unique games I have ever played, and how well you'll like it depends fully on whether you buy into its premise. Here's the short of it: the Obra Dinn--a ship that many assumed had been lost at sea--mysteriously returned home. You head to the Obra Dinn to try to figure out what happened. With you, you carry a notebook and an odd-looking stopwatch. At the Obra Dinn, you find only human remains. You can use the stopwatch at these remains to see the very last moment of that person's life, suspended in time like a 3D photograph. The game records some (very little) of that information in your notebook, but leaves the most important questions up to you: who was that person? How did they die? Who (or what) killed them? Answering all of these questions is what the game calls ""solving a fate"". Solving all fates is the goal of Return of the Obra Dinn.In most cases, answering the ""how"" question is not a big deal. After all, your watch shows you people flinching in pain as they are shot, stabbed, struck, clubbed, crushed, burned... or whatever other unfortunate fate befell them. What's really tricky is answering the other questions. Who was that person? At the start of the game, you don't know who anyone is, which likely means you also don't know who killed them. Oh, did I mention there were 60 crew members on the Obra Dinn when it left England? Good luck figuring out everyone's fates!Thankfully, the game does a few things to help you, all of which through your trusty notebook. You have a manifest that lists the names and occupations of everyone at the Obra Dinn. You have a series of sketches that tell you how people looked like. Very rarely, when you witness someone's death through the stopwatch, you'll be able to hear their name or find other decisive information, which makes uncovering their identity trivial. But this happens very rarely, and, for the most part, you have to do the heavy lifting yourself. But what's probably the most helpful is that the game assigns everyone a ""deduction rating"", which tells you how hard it will be to figure out their identities. Deduction ratings range from 1 (trivial) to 3 (whoooo boy). Going after the low-hanging fruit first is not just ""a good idea"", it is absolutely critical, as some 3-score identities can only be deduced by elimination. With each fate you encounter, the game automatically fills out your notebook. With each fate you solve, the notebook reflects it, crossing out names and locking information in place. There's a satisfying physicality to it, not unlike the feeling you get from writing down a huge to-do list and crossing out items as you complete them.A lot of your time playing this game will be spent revisiting memories, over, and over, and over again, obsessing over each and every little detail of grisly death scenes, looking for whatever clues you can find. Some of the fates are fiendishly hard and will require a lot of brainpower and attention to detail. It's all fun and games when you're solving the easier fates, but the hardest ones can feel straight-up unfun, almost, depending on how you handle frustration. The game is never unfair, though: there's always information somewhere that allows you to solve fates (and it usually looks pretty obvious in hindsight).All of this makes Obra Dinn a great game that I cannot blindly recommend to everyone. There's so much in it that can put people off: the art style (gorgeous but incredibly disorienting), the difficulty, the repetition (which isn't much since the game is really short)... it all makes for a singular and unforgettable experience, but you have to know what you're getting into. I know this is true for all games, but it feels even more true for this one. This a game that does one thing, and one thing only--and does it incredibly well. In a world where most AAA games try to be everything at once, Obra Dinn's laser-sharp focus is nothing short of admirable.",positive

You have to be very observant while examining the few scenes you get to see, noticing every single detail as it happens in those freeze frames and make assumptions and guesses based on all your gathered information.It's a brilliant detective game, and the art and music are brilliant again, as they were in Papers, Please!.

Return of the Obra Dinn,"So insanely good. Finally, a detective game done completely right. There's no hand-holding and your conclusions are based on, literally, hundreds of tiny observations. Obra Dinn has an interesting narrative that unfolds into something completely buckwild and the entire experience is further enhanced by the unique visual style and fantastic soundtrack. This definitely gets a 10/10 and I wish I could play it for the first time again.Some tips for playing this game: Take detailed notes for every scene - write down everything you can see and hear. You're given lots of little clues as to who people are, which can be a little overwhelming considering there are 60 characters, but note-taking will greatly help. Also, many of your deductions will be based solely on accents/nationalities and also uniforms/clothing. Refer often to the image in your journal that contains all crewmembers - pay attention to where characters are standing and who they're standing next to.",positive
Return of the Obra Dinn,"A must play for anyone who enjoys detective games, it was a bit overwhelming and challenging for my potato brain though, but really fun.It's a hit or miss depending if you enjoy the core mechanic, which involves a lot of repeating the same scenes, and although the aesthetic is pretty cool, it can get exhausting on the eyes specially in a long session.

Return of the Obra Dinn,"Return of the Obra Dinn is a masterpiece in the mystery/detective/puzzle solving genre, and is all-round one of my most treasured, fondest and best experiences with a video game in 18 years of playing.Video games, I believe, are often the sum of their parts, and in the case of Return of the Obra Dinn, the parts are all rich, prolific, engrossing and speckled with the sweat of the toil of the game's developer, a creative mastermind named Lucas Pope.Direction/Narrative/LoreThe game is heavily inspired from the ""Ship with missing crew""/Maritime mystery trope (E.g the Mary Celesete, Franklin's lost expedition, etc), you are an insurance inspector (a rather unique and original backdrop for a video game character) working for the British East India Company. You are summoned to conduct a damages assessment to a company Indiaman (a commercial vessel intended to transport goods between Europe and the Orient) that drifted back to Falmouth with some of it's crews either missing, a few members are present in their skeletal visages.The game has two potential endings depending on your skills as an investigator. And features very interesting twists and revelations to the story of the Obra Dinn and her journey. It is difficult for me to dilate further on this due to story spoilers.GameplayThe gameplay of Return of the Obra dinn is rather simple straightforward, yet despite this many find it confusing due to the very little handholding the game offers. The game straight away throws you into the fray, it teaches you the most important basics. But the hands-on, unswerving introduction can be so overwhelming that many people can gloss over several basics. The gameplay as a whole is pressing a few keys on the keyboard and using your mouse to point your first person character's view, what makes the gameplay so engulfing is the fact that your own rationale and reasoning is involved here as much as your skills to play video games are.You are provided with a parcel from Henry Evans, a certain member of the ship who managed to survive, he offers you a small pocket watch that has a magical property that allows you to visit the memories of the ship's voyage through the corpses you find in it, each memory will lead up to how that particular corpse came to be (it's cause of death and the events therein). The parcel also contains a journal, this journal is going to be filled by you by means of the previously mentioned pocket watch. These two items are core to the gameplay and narrative of Return of the Obra Dinn. The journal contains the crew manifest of the ship, a layout of the ship with maps, two art sketches depicting the life on the ship and many of it's crew members and passengers, and lots, lots and lots of empty pages that you are going to fill, these pages tell the journey and story of the ship, how everything came to be, the crew manifest must be filled in by you, you must visually identify and corroborate all crew members with their respective artistic depiction on the sketches, and you must correctly name all the fates of the 60 people that were on-board the ship when it departed Falmouth. You are to utilise all the tools aforementioned in addition to your own cognitive capabilities and logical subtraction & hypothesising to attach the strings between the faces on the sketches, the names on the manifest, and the fates that happened to these named faces. This may appear a daunting task, but the presentation and furnishing of this game is so incredible and engaging that it becomes a task brimming with absorption, engrossment and curiosity. The souls that were onboard the ship have either expired due to a long list of different causes, or survived and fled elsewhere. While correctly distinguishing and identifying 60 individuals onboard can sound extremely arduous, the fates of the individuals onboard are validated in sets of 3, this allows you to know which people you correctly identified, and when, and if you have written down the fates of many individuals, it will, implicitly, suggest which ones you are mistaken on. This mechanic, while making your insurance inspector's journey significantly easier, is alsoextremelysatisfying and well-designed by Mr. Pope.VisualsThis game is dripping with individual uniqueness and creativity thanks to the combination of the backdrop, the approach on the investigation, the story, the characters and their fates. One thing to ice the cake with Return of the Obra Dinn is the visuals. They are one of my favourite things about the game. The game's visuals are so simple and bare-bones, yet so rich and ample. It is modeled after the graphics of Microsoft MS-DOS computers, apparently in nostalgic spirit by the developer. There are several other visual output options that include different graphics of very old computers, such as Macintosh, LCD, the Commodore 64, etc. The animations of the game are ridiculously good, and despite the absolute simplicity of the visuals, it feels extremely alive. The moonlight, the clouds, the waves, the rocking of the ship are all vigorous and dynamic. Despite the monochromatic nature of the visuals, the game conveys lighting in it's own way, where there is significant shading and ambiant lighting on the upper decks that are exposed to moonlight, the lower ones are purely monochrome and devoid of simulated lighting, implying an atmosphere of darkness. The art style and visuals, are overall, very captivating.Sound design/Music ScoreThis I believe is another one of Return of the Obra Dinn's strongest suits. The sound design of this game is so good it legitimately become one of my highest bars and standards of solid video game acoustics. It is absolutely unbelievable listening to this resonating, borderline ASMR audio and thinking this was made by one indie developer. This game straight up possesses audio design superior to expensive AAA titles produced by huge companies. A combination of spatial surround USB 7.1 Headphones make this game a completely living and animated experience. The sound of the waves hitting the wet wood of the ship's hull, the menacing creaking, croaking, huffing and puffing of the vessel's timbers, which realistically grows louder the deeper you descend through the ship's decks, the sound of the breeze thumping into the ship's rigging and sails, and subtler things like the very refined audio for the pocket watch, opening the journal, your inspector's footsteps, everything down to the most minute thing has very clearly had fostered attention for it's sound design.The music, oh, the music. It doesn't end with the sound design, because Return of the Obra Dinn genuinely has one of the best music scores my ears have ever had the pleasure to be entranced with. I have played this game to it's completion over 60 days ago. Yet to this day I still listen to the Doom, the Escape and the End chapter's music. The game overall is an incredible summation of so many well thought and well designed elements, but what really rounds it all up into the master piece it is - is the music score. It's my personal peak and highest point of this game. And once again, only enlarges my admiration of Lucas Pope as a developer. The man has unbelievable amounts of creativity that I really really wish I can see more video games by him.VerdictI have engaged in extremely bombastic praise of this game throughout my review, I try for my reviews to often be as thorough and detailed as possible, discussing the game's mechanics more than it's virtues - Yet this game is too simple and too mystic to allow me to discuss it at any greater depth. I will call it by it's proper name - An indie masterpiece. It is genuinely one of my best video game experiences of my lifetime, despite being a one-man project indie game. I wholeheartedly recommend Return of the Obra Dinn, especially to players that enjoy the mystery or investigative genre.",positive

Return of the Obra Dinn,"A rather underrated challenge in designing puzzle games is finding ways to make the puzzles appear natural. Obviously this isnât a consideration for something like sudoku, but for games where you move around within a world and experience more than just brain-teasers, the presence of puzzles can stick out like a sore thumb. Return of the Obra Dinn tackles this by making the entire game one giant puzzle, an interlocking set of deductions and suppositions that build upon each other until youâve revealed the entire design. And the fact that it does so with an incredible story and pervasive sense of dread leaves it very much at the pinnacle of several genres.In 1803, the merchant ship Obra Dinn was lost at sea, with all 60 crew and passengers assumed lost with it. Four years later, the Obra Dinn was discovered drifting in the North Atlantic, its sails damaged and its crew missing. You are cast as an insurance investigator for the East India Company, who have a very obvious interest in the fate of the ship and its cargo. Dispatched to examine the vessel and determine the damages, you are also sent with a special package from an interested third party. The contents of this package will provide you the means to uncover the true fates of every soul aboard the ship, and reveal the shape of the dark events that gripped its journey.Your journal provides a comprehensive overview of the shipâs route, maps of the decks, a complete crew manifest, and sketches of the crew across several scenes. The rest of the tome is divided into chapters that cover the events of the Obra Dinnâs fateful voyage. When you find the remains of someone on the ship, their entry is added to the chapter where they met their ultimate fate. Your job is to determine who they are, what happened to them, and if someone or something had a hand in events, who they were as well. Every time you complete three entries, the game confirms them and locks them in. Itâs a clever way to allow for educated guessing without allowing players to brute-force every fate in the book.But how do you determine these fates? Well, if you donât mind a small spoiler for a game mechanic you discover five minutes in, you have a tool that allows you to witness the moment of death of any corpse or remains you find. Youâll hear the last few seconds of events leading up to the deed, and then you are given free reign to wander around the macabre scene, frozen in time. From here the cause of death is usually (but not always) obvious, and you can begin to make deductions on identities based on circumstances, positions, gestures, even objects around the person. Itâs not only the victim, either, because you get an expansive scene of what was happening around them, often enough to make conclusions about complete bystanders. And every detail is going to count when working out the identities of an entire ship of people.This is what I really want to stress, how incredibly clever and natural puzzling out the mysteries is. The first few entries are bound to be simple enough, figuring out who the captain is or marking off crew who actually get called by name. But then you get to scenes where someone is calling a name into a crowd. Or scenes with all the topmen up in the rigging, performing their duties. Or scenes with a body wrapped tight, with others discussing them in vague terms. Never will a character say someoneâs name or label something just to give it away, these are natural conversations and natural interactions that you have to read into as hard as possible to solve the puzzle. Everything matters in these scenes, from a strange accent to a hand resting on a doorknob to a scrap of paper in an odd place. After I completed every fate, I went back to look at guides to help me sort out the story and discovered I had missed fully half the clues in the game with my educated guessing.And then thereâs the story. Believe me, it would be more than enough if Return of the Obra Dinn was just a perfectly-constructed puzzle box of random scenes. But these scenes give you tantalizing glimpses into one of the most tragically cursed voyages imaginable. The despair and desperation in some of these scenes is palpable, even frozen as they are, and the plot is a twisting, sordid affair thatâs just as tricky to puzzle out as your task. Itâs a shockingly intense game at times, and I guarantee there will be a moment early on that blows your expectations wide open. When that happens the gameâs tone turns to 11 and only builds from there as you pile more and more horrific events up. The story is also told out of order in a very compelling way, and even keeps one middle chapter off-limits until you complete the rest of the game, providing a fine coda to wrap up your final suspicions once your task is done.For anyone intimidated by the scope of the mystery, Return of the Obra Dinn also features a ton of considerations for helping you organize and focus on your work. For the first half-hour or so of the game, it will give you direct instructions on how your tools work, explain the mechanics of determining fates and making connections, and so on. The journal has all sorts of handy linking and bookmarking features, as well as some helpful indicators on how difficult uncovering an identity will be at different points. Thereâs also a few points where the game will helpfully tell you that youâre done with something, which went a long way to keeping my uncertainties focused on the job instead of the game mechanics.All this is presented in an incredibly stylish low-res 3D motif that mimics the feel of an old Amiga or Apple IIe. Seriously, there are even options to change the color scheme to copy those, the Commodore, and more. The chunky style can make some details a bit hard to make out, but there was clear effort to minimize these troubles as much as possible and itâs entirely worth it for how breathtaking some of the scenes end up being. The sound design is just as good, with perfectly evocative effects, a moody soundtrack, and some surprisingly good voice acting. Any one of these features, from the presentation to the game design to the writing, would be enough to make this a classic. But somehow Return of the Obra Dinn has it all, making it a puzzling adventure that everyone needs to experience.Did you enjoy this review? I certainly hope so, and I certainly hope you'll check out more of them on mycuration page!",positive
Return of the Obra Dinn,"Return of the Obra Dinn is an intricately crafted Mystery game, where you are an Insurance investigator, and have to solve the fates of the 60 people aboard the Ship.The game is great, The unique game mechanics, the music the presentation, everything. The feeling of satisfaction you get when the music plays to signal that you've solved the fates of three people correctly is incomparable. You need to be paying attention to the spoken dialogue and surroundings in each scene to glean information to the identities of the people and what eventually happened to them, so it is recommended that you attempt to complete in a week or two, since you will be juggling with a bit of information.But the way the game is, it has two problems.The first of them being that It appeals to a very niche audience. An hour or two in, you're either completely hooked or won't touch the game again.And the second, since it's written and goes according to a script and delicately built around that, instead of being randomly generated or something, you can't really replay it. Maybe you can a few years down the line, when you've forgotten about it entirely, but nine times out of ten you'll remember who the guy in front of you is and what had happened to him.In Conclusion, Return of the Obra Dinn is a short and enjoyable experience which makes you flex your unused brain muscles, but leaves you craving for more with nothing to satiate that hunger.Recommend Wholeheartedly.",positive

Return of the Obra Dinn,"Return of the Obra Dinn is at its core a detective game. The ship Obra Dinn mysteriously floats back to shore and you are tasked with finding out what happened to the 60 people that were on board including the crew. In your possession is a magical pocket watch that shows you the last moments of a corpse. Using this you have to piece together the fate of everyone that was onboard the Obra Dinn.Pros- Very Original concept.- Game can be solved in any order and no two people will be able to complete the game in the same sequence.- Supernatural story set in the 1800 with good voice acting and despite the 1-bit rendering everything is easy to understand and follow.Cons- The graphics may not be for everyone (I found them charming for the record).- Once you solve the game there isn't any replayability.Return of the Obra Dinn was one of my best gaming experiences. I completed the game several times because of how much i enjoyed it despite there not being a reason to replay it. Made by a solo dev (Lucas Pope) this is as good as Indie games get in my opinion. Put it on your wishlist and pick it up when you see a sale. This is one of those game that you should consider trying if you are open to new genres and games that are not your usual staple.I have also made a full walkthrough solving every fate and explaining in detail how i came to those conclusions.

Return of the Obra Dinn,"Product received for free""Captain! Open the door!""God, what a fantastic game. There are plenty of mystery games out there in which you play as a detective or investigator, finding clues to piece together crimes and catch culprits. But very few makeyou, the player, feel like a detective as much as Return of the Obra Dinn.It's 1807, and you're the chief inspector for the East India Company. The Obra Dinn, a ship that's been lost at sea for years, drifts into port with all its crew dead or missing. Using a supernatural pocketwatch, you have the ability to see the exact moment of a person's death. Your job is to figure out the identities and ultimate fates of all 60 people aboard the Obra Dinn during its voyage.Of course, it's a bit more complicated than that. The identities of the victims and their killers are rarely spelled out for you, and you'll need to cross-reference not just how they died, but their location on the ship, who they hang out with, what they're wearing, the language they're speaking... Sure, you can figure out who the Captain is pretty easily, but can you pinpoint some random guy who nobody ever addresses?That's Obra Dinn's biggest draw: it's a game about the joy of detective work, and the thrill of using logical reasoning to fit everything into place. It reminds me of first-person puzzle games like Antichamber or The Witness, where you feel like you're trapped inside a giant puzzle that appears nigh impenetrable at the start, but gets more and more reasonable as you unravel it from within. You're given all the tools you need to intuit every crew member's fate without brute force, although there's no hint system beyond just general tips. Can't figure out someone's identity? Follow that person back through time to gather more clues, or move to a different person and come back later. (If you'rereallystuck but don't want to just look up the answer, there's an excellent hint/nudge guide on Steam.)It doesn't skimp on the presentation, either. Its 1-bit old-computer-style graphics aren't as headache-inducing as I thought they'd be before I played, and now I can't imagine the game without it. The music tracks flow well together and perfectly convey the themes of death and mystery. The fact that this entire game was mostly put together by a single person makes it all the more impressive.I could go on and on about what I like about Return of the Obra Dinn, but I think I've made my point. If you fancy yourself a mystery/detective/puzzle game fan, especially ones that are light on tutorials and hand-holding, this is a shining example of the genre that's not to be missed.",positive
Return of the Obra Dinn,"I hate puzzles. I suck at them, and it took me a long time to get around to picking this one up. And I am still honestly in shock at how phenomenal this game is. I struggle to even use the word game. This is one of those special masterpieces that truly show this medium's worthiness to be considered art. There is nothing like Return of the Obra Dinn and it breaks my heart that so many will never experience it. If you haven't played it, this is the definetion of a must-play game. Please buy it.

Return of the Obra Dinn,"Return of the Obra Dinn is a puzzle game where you play as an insurance agent, exploring a derelict ship at sea. There are no monsters to fight; there is no treasure to uncover; there is no great evil to vanquish. There is only you, the bones of the dead, and a magical watch that lets you travel back in time to the exact moment of their death.Your goal is, on paper, simple - determine exactly how every member of the Obra Dinn's crew died. For the most part, the game won't tell you this. You have to do some thinking of your own and figure it out by context cues, clothing, equipment, time and place, and other similar clues. The feeling of immense satisfaction you get when the game verifies that your latest batch of deductions was correct is something that's difficult to put a price tag on.The plot, needless to say, is almost impossible to discuss without spoilers, but I enjoyed it immensely, and I wasn't disappointed by the payoff. That's all I'll say about it here, because unraveling the mystery of what happened to the Obra Dinn is the main point of the game; it's a mystery worth unraveling.I won't deny that I was biased in favor of this game before I ever started it, as I'm a massive sucker for any historical fiction set between 1700 to 2000. That being said, the game makes the setting work as hard as it possibly can; the audio design, musical direction, and general atmosphere-building are all flawlessly executed, and do incredible things when it comes to building a world through still-life shots of people dying gruesome deaths.",positive

Return of the Obra Dinn,"Top-notch investigative adventure with unique graphics and disturbing story.No one knows what happened aboard Obra Dinn, and no one really wants to find out why the shipâs crew was wiped out entirely. No one but insurance, that is. These guys â they get everywhere, no matter how strange the circumstances are. You - a resolute and business-minded insurance agent who isnât put off by prospect of over 50 deaths from heaven knows what (armed with a crew manifesto, a mysterious watch that has power over time and an inquiring mind) - are set on determining what happened. All these insurance claims arenât going to write themselves, you know?This story has a fascinating aspect â it is already completed. Using deductive and observational skills, youâll be piecing together HOW exactly it was done. Usually, players push the story forward by solving puzzles and making choices, here, however, akin to real-life investigation, youâre working on an incident that already took place â no different outcomes, no story progression, no new events, or dialogues or, really, anything beyond the mystery you need to untangle. And what a riveting process it is! Working in reverse, youâll start unraveling this ball of yarn, thread by a careful thread. Paying attention to every detail, listening and looking intently and, most importantly, using deductive and analytical skills, youâll uncover what terrifying and tragic events took place aboard the ship in the middle of its sea voyage. Or not. Just remember, insurance never sleeps.Those investigative skills are indispensable as this is pure, brilliant mystery solving.  Youâll start working on the first death on a seemingly empty ship, using that strange pocket watch youâve been sent. It allows you to hear and see last moments of people right before their demise, and after playing a scene, it will stop in a strange freeze-frame of a memory, where you get to walk around and see what the scene was like, who was in it, and what were they doing at the moment. One of the death memories will lead to another and another but, remember, despite seeing peopleâs faces and have a list of their names, you still have no idea who is who, and that is precisely what youâll be doing â taking in the scene, the details, the accents, the clothing, ranks and statuses, you will be putting faces to names and figuring out the exact cause of death, some of which areâ¦ letâs say âquite unusualâ. This is a gloriously absorbing process for all the lovers of solving âwhodunitsâ, and where the difficulty will depend on your ability to pay attention and patience. In a way, it can be described as a lovechild of a logical puzzle and a jigsaw one â youâre putting little pieces of a big picture together, going off the obscure facts and shreds of information in your possession along with a novel visual/audio element of that âvery lastâ scene.This visual component is (unsurprisingly) distinctive and might look strange at a first glance. It is an odd blend of 3D freeze-frames, done in what looks like vector graphics that were stippled with a paint brush in monochrome tones. (There are several versions of color schemes that could be changed to mimic your preferred older system). Itâs eye-catching, head-scratching and perfectly fitting to investigating deaths on Obra Dinn. The tragic scenes gain a layer of stoicism, and the horrifying ones â a layer of peculiarity, when watched through means of static, black & white, astonishingly detailed screens. The animations are smooth and realistic, which makes for a pleasantly stylish observation of dozens of fatalities. Stuff like that simply begs to be observed in good taste.The voice-over is spectacular here and is a large part of investigation. The shipâs crew is from all around the world, so youâll hear not just different accents but plenty of different languages, and youâll need to use all that information in order to solve the mystery. Music is appropriately grand and atmospheric. It plays in the moments of rewinding memories and serves as a background while walking through freeze-frames of memories adding a dose of uneasiness. Sound effects are top notch and share the spotlight with voice acting. At times, youâll be walking in silence through an empty ship analyzing your evidence, and thatâs where you can hear the entire universe of sounds. Every creak, groan, squeak, every gust of wind or a foreboding hum of an upcoming storm will be your main companions. Walking through memories will give you another myriad of sounds depending on where the action is - moving cannons around gun deck, battling elements on the main deck or maybe having an unpleasant encounter with someone at night. All of this makes the transformation from being an insurance agent aboard the forsaken ship to being a part of the last moments of the crew utterly immersive.âReturn of the Obra Dinnâ is a must for any investigative adventure lover. It could even be called a must for ANY adventure lover, but itâs good to keep in mind that this game is built on one beautiful, well-crafted âlogical jigsawâ puzzle that while making an actual investigation in the world of gaming close to perfect, still requires for a player to sit and think things through, observe and listen, ponder and deduct as a major driven force of the game. Itâs not a âtypicalâ adventure, but it seems that Lucas Pope (creator of âPapers, Pleaseâ) doesnât really do âtypicalâ, so there is no surprise there. This is truly a one-of-a-kind gem that deserves all the praise itâs gotten. Iâm positively jealous of anyone whoâs about to discover âReturn of the Obra Dinnâ for the first time.",positive

Return of the Obra Dinn,"One day, Lucas Art betrayed me. When I was young, I used to hang out with many adventure games, clicking everywhere, trying to combine things and stuffs, life was simple. I still remember this day when one of them asked me to bend a monkey to use it as a crank. I closed to game and made the promise to never play an adventure game again.An then, I met Obra Dinn. I must confess that it was first, his look that attracted me but I knew that this one was different. That was confirmed on the boat, when I was looking for some animal to torture, the game stopped me and told me to end this madness. All he wants from me was to listen, the accents, the sounds, the tones. To observe the outfits, the expressions, the behaviours. To analyze, the story, the links, the paths ...A simple relation based on honesty and logical deduction. This day, I fell in love again with adenture games thanks to Lucas Pope.",positive
Return of the Obra Dinn,"Return of the Obra Dinn is a masterfully crafted and fantastically fresh take on the mystery-puzzle genre.

While you are in the past, you are able to see a still image of the cause of death while also being able to walk around freely. The game is split up into multiple chapters which hold a certain amount of crew mates and their fates you must figure out.

Return of the Obra Dinn,"It's impossible to write anything extensive about this game without spoiling some of what makes the experience so wonderful, so I'll be brief: it's outstanding.Avoid knowing things about it before playing if you possibly can.",positive
Return of the Obra Dinn,"I put off playing this game for the longest time and I have NO IDEA WHY! This game was incredible, and I wish I could experience it for the first time again. It is 100% doable without hints or spoilers, so definitely don't do yourself a disservice by looking them up. Now I will just be impatiently waiting for the next game like this",positive
Return of the Obra Dinn,"TL;DR:Great game if you enjoy making mental notes, doing comfortably challenging deductive work and guesswork occasionally.Unlike one specific game that chose to discard such things in pursuit of a more purified experience, gameplay elements here are sufficient to encourage you to dwell deeper.Stylish and expressive graphics, fantastic audio.Finished all cases in a 7-hour sitting.You are on board the Obra Dinn.You have two tools at your disposal: an eerie pocketwatch; a book awaiting completion.You are tasked to find out: for those who lived, their whereabouts; for those less fortunate, what fate had in store for them. The game is afoot, inspector.I'll start by saying this: Return of the Obra Dinn is a good game, and as of the delivery of the good, a clever game as well. A game in which you observe and deduce. Whoo Hoo!From this point onwards, I'll attempt to dismantle the game and see why is it so enjoyable and memorable, so I discourage you from reading a word further. Explaining a game is like dissecting a frog, after all.Allow me to throw in an idiotic syllogistic statement here:Video games are Cookie Clicker.Cookie Clicker is all about loops.Video games are all about loops.Jokes aside, despite the obviously wrong premise where many art games that have no structured system are excluded, most games are just Cookie Clicker with shells in different colors. A loop is often both the means and the end, incrementally or detrimentally contributing towards a final goal.In Obra Dinn, the primary loop consists of two minor loops. I'll call it ""watch and learn"". Each requires one aforementioned tool, produces one set of feedback:WatchTool: ""the pocketwatch""Direct Feedback: audio, 3D hologramPositive Feedback: more corpses to look atWhen approaching remnants or reminiscent of a death scene, the pocketwatch would prompt you to investigate. Should you oblige the cue, you will be taken back to the exact moment of death, presented to you two pieces of information on the death, on two periods of time: an audio track recorded shortly before the death, and a static death-scene in which you can navigate around and observe.LearnTool: ""the book""Direct Feedback: a pat on the shoulder (upon three / two accumulative correct completions)Positive Feedback: easier deduction time, yayThe book provides in great detail a map of the voyage, illustrated deck plans, a list the crew and passenger, including name, position and nationality, and a set of illustrations of every person on board. Parts of chapters displaying who, when, how are activated as death scenes as you investigate death scenes.It is both the means and the end. You are asked to fill out the book by identifying and deciding the fate or whereabouts of all crew members. In doing so, each finding is a breakthrough to the rest.To sum it up: you watch, and you learn. As you learn, you see more from what you watch.Clearly, both departments operate in a positive feedback loop. In human language: you progress and get better, the game gets easier, you progress further. Now, people usually reach out for what they call Flow Theory for help so that the game would not be rendered tedious.Obra Dinn does no such things. Because it doesn't need to.While its content delivery does present itself in a structured system, it does not depend upon any structured system. You don't progress by growing a number, nor do you venture forth by clearing a map, but... yeah, you actually do. When I said Obra Dinn's content doesn't depend on system apparatus, it's because the fun comes from truth-seeking, from deduction, from the moment to moment ""eureka"" where you hear things click beautifully. These happen in your head. When I said its content present itself in a system, it's because it neatly tracks cases chronologically, spatially, interactively and graphically, rules out identities you've already determined, congratulates you on your intelligent work from time to time, and motivates, provides you with one explicit quota to meet, et cetera.At first, I couldn't help but compare Obra Dinn against Herstory. Both games throw you right into the post-mortem, the aftermath of a tragedy, and first and foremost, the center of a mystery. In that, you have fun in painstakingly dismantling what is shown to you into pieces, and put the pieces back together, then you take a step back, admire your intelligent work. Even the end is not so unlike: you get a call, and you choose to leave or not. You get to decide if you are satisfied with what you have.I took my fair share of notes playing Herstory, but I made none playing Obra Dinn, that's the way they are different. Obra Dinn is the more video-game-y of the two, in this case. While Herstory refrains from implementing any gameplay element, Obra Dinn is friendly enough to provide you the said set of systematic tools. No more handwritten notes. Take the end for example as well. In Obra Dinn, if you have not completed all cases, you will be told so, while in Herstory you just leave. What you've gathered from pieces of interviews is strictly in your head (and your messy note, of course).From that, I believe I can dimly see the difference between the two approaches, and how two games are built around them. Herstory does not attempt to explain to you a definitive truth: seeking truth is stern, is an introspective pursuit. In Obra Dinn, as the meticulous nature of the way clues are scattered around, the meticulous nature of the character's profession, seeking truth is joy, is an activity to be rewarded (Lucas Pope went as far to give you an extra chapter if you leave will every fate filled out accurately).Then again, none is necessarily more superior, but I must confess I enjoyed Obra Dinn more. It's because Obra Dinn is a clever game. Remember I said it's clever earlier? That's because for me, the most clever way to empower the player is not to make them feel forceful, but rather, to let them feel smart, which is precisely what Obra Dinn's loop of progression does.It's done in the utmost delicacy, by imposing slight challenges that are seemingly quite impossible, such is the gap between perceived challenge and actual challenge. Among them, subtly apparent clues are placed in death scenes, in audio tracks, in illustrations, in the crew list, and in the combination of them. Call it hand-holding as you might, visibly absent but omnipresent hand-holding is hand-holding done right.I felt smart when I through audio logs and pieces of foreign language located some specific crew, from a thrown boat in the distance decided the fate of certain missing persons. I felt even smarter when I found out that from formation and dress code depicted in the illustrations, I could produce enough educated guesses to work out their identity. Then, a pat on my shoulder, a ""well done"" text on-screen, and I would think, ""a-ha, knew I was on the right track.""Thus, the entirety of the Obra Dinn is assembled. At least that's how I'd imagine it's done. Then, in a loop so bewitching to the point of intoxicatingly satisfying, I finish all sixty cases in one sitting, I was hungry for truth, and I was hungry for food afterward.",positive
Return of the Obra Dinn,It's probably safe to say that this is one of the best games I've ever played.,positive
Return of the Obra Dinn,I completed the whole game in one sitting. For 8 hours I was just glued to my PC and only got up for food. That's how good this game is.Alright Do you like puzzle games ? Do you like the feeling when all the pieces just click into place and everything starts to make sense ? Then you will fall in love with Obra Dinn.The Gameplay loop is basically Finding a Corpse or Skeleton of a crew member > Check their memories to see how they died > Figure out the identity of the person that got killed and who or what killed them. Many times you'll have to revisit memories to figure out what exactly happened and look for all the small details and clues. This simple design is so addictive that I wouldn't have mind if the game was a bit longer.The music and sound effects are brilliant. The audio always manages to keep the environment filled with tension and suspense. The voice acting with all the different languages and accents is great too. Really makes you feel like all these victims were real people.Overall 10/10. Return of the Obra Dinn is a masterpiece. It may not be for everyone but if it is for you then you will absolutely love it. Unique games like this come rarely so definitely give it a try.,positive
Return of the Obra Dinn,"I'm about an two and a half hours into this game and it's superb. Absolutely superb. I'm stuck so I've taken a break, but this is 100% my favorite game I've played in forever. The amount of clues that lean just enough that if you think about them you get answers is AMAZING.  The fact that you have to make inferences is AMAZING. I've had to TAKE NOTES! NOTES! IN A GAME! WITH A PENCIL! This game is perfection.Not only is it absoutely stunning, but it isn't too difficult. It's hard, don't get me wrong this game is hard, but it gives you everything you need to know. You just have to work at it. Two hours passed me playing this game and I barely noticed it'd even been that long. It's that kind of game.I didn't expect to like the lack of animation as much as I did. The action secenes don't happen in front of you, you hear them but don't see them, and it works really really well. better even, than it woud with them.Just try it. OMG just try it. You'll not regret it.",positive
Return of the Obra Dinn,"I waited 4 years for this game to be released and paid full price on d-day to have it here. And let me tell y'all that this was bloody worth it!First I would like to say how Lucas Pope is a narrative game design genius, I mean he's the guy who makes paperwork fun, and dramatic. I think we all remember playing Papers, Please and how that game which pitch would've sound boring turned out being masterfully crafted.Here we find Pope's signature gameplay, formal paperwork, however it gets completely different as you get to see entire scenes, more artistic designs, and great voice acting, compared to his other games.I won't talk about the story since it would be a huge spoiler because the game entirely relies on it, and what isn't a spoiler is already revealed on the Steam description. However I can say that this is one of the few investigative game that required actual deduction skills (by that I mean, actually making logical conclusions, not just entering any weird combinaison hoping it would work). The game holds you by the hand with a bunch of deaths by giving names, but for other, you'll need to carefully watch for any details that could give out someone's job on the boat, or their crew number. You will also need a bit of 19th century nautical knowledge to sort out uniforms, how officers wore certain hats; and of course linguistic knowledge, because crewmates on the Obra Dinn comes from every corner of the world and a bunch of them knows a native language on top of English.I've seen some people complaining about how the game does not give enough clues to deduce the fate of everyone for them, but let me tell you it gives you just enough, and that you really really need to check everything in each scene.The sound design is masterfully created, between the soundtrack which is great and give the correct tone, and the voice acting that perfectly fits. I'm just glad sometimes the game gives you blind sequences with only the sound to rely for gathering info, because it is that good.However, among the few cons I found, sound design is the cause, I feel that there isn't enough depth to the hearing parts, you don't get to hear much background noises, you don't get to hear people walking on the upper deck while you're in the lower parts of the boat, you just won't hear people who are too far in the background. I think there's possibly an explanation for that in the game (the same way you can't get to see too far when using the watch), but I believe the real reason was more technical, which is a shame because it would've helped more to find some clues that aren't in the scene's spotlight.The other con is making a French character and only give him one line with like, two words in it. I am salty about that one because I spotted that character since I played the demo somewhere in 2014, and I wanted so bad to hear a character with a French accent.Anyways, this game is a must have, great story albeit a bit short, great soundtrack, and of course, great Ditherpunk graphics, which is possibly the reason why so much people went to get that game, it will make your eyes ache after playing a couple of hours without pausing, but it gives such an unique atmosphere that it's worth it. On top of that you'll get to visit a very detailled 19th century ship with accuracy on how life was aboard!",positive
Return of the Obra Dinn,"Lucas Pope has a style, and that style is making you actually perform the challenges in the game instead of modelling them. In Papers, Please you had to actually find discrepancies in documents; likewise, in Obra Dinn, a mystery game that has you uncover the fates of many dead people aboard a tragedy-stricken ship, you don't get any sorts of ""Compare Clues"" button.In this game, if you want to compare clues, you have to actually do it.At the start of Obra Dinn, you are provided with the list of everyone who was aboard, a sketch of their faces, and a clock that lets you see the last memory of a corpse. Now it's up to you to cross-reference an incredible number of events, meticulously writing down everyone's cause of death whileâand this is the game's main challengeâassigning identities.Sure, some of them are relatively straightforward: there were two sets of siblings on the ship, and a couple of names are mentioned directly in the memories, and did you notice who was it that tasked you with unveiling the mystery in the first place? But straightforward identities are rare and far between, and in no time you'll find yourself having to distinguish between four rather identical Chinese seamen.Most cases of death are, to the contrary, straightforward, but sometimes you'll have to actually think hard and model the whole situation, like when someone goes MIA or is wounded way before they bleed to death.Does it all sound fun to you? Well, it bloody is. The game is brilliant at giving just enough clues to make you do educated guesses. You'll have to listen to accents, note the types of clothes, or who stands where on the sketches, or in which room a person is typically found. And I can't stress enough how awesome it is that there are no shortcuts, no gamisms, no buttons saying things like ""Determine X's Origin."" If you want to find a Polynesian of this ship, you'll have to actually turn your brain on and think which of them looks Polynesian, like you would do in real life.No mystery game I've played has ever made me feel this close to being an actual detective. Even the good ones, like Ace Attorney, are mostly about guessing the creators' logic (""you won't leave this screen until you've clicked all the clues""). Obra Dinn, on the other hand, lets you looseâthus making all your findings feel yours, and yourself, smart.The music is, as expected, stunning. The visuals are unusual, but not random: this game is, to a large extent, about the recognition of faces and other distinctive features, which the pixellated visuals make both easier and harder.The only downside I can think of is that in the end, Obra Dinn is a bit too easy to brute force. Whenever you find a dead body and are sure about the nature of their death, you have zero reason not to try and assign an identity to itâany random oneâbecause you might happen to guess right. (Each time you write down three fates correctly, the game confirms them; after that, you can change the names of all other victims, since this also confirms they were wrong, and try the guesswork cycle again...)Then again, I guess it can't be helped, and it's up to the player not to detract from the fun by cheesing.P. S. And, unlike oh so many adventures, it takes some effort to make sure all ambiguous causes of death accept more than one answer, like when a person was thrown overboard by a beast, you can choose ""fell overboard"" or ""crushed by a beast"". So, no game logic stupidity here either.",positive
Return of the Obra Dinn,"Definitely a once in a lifetime kinda experience. Absolutely brutal story; with enough hints to keep you going but enough open endedness to make your deductions, when correct, make you feel like a genius. 100% worth a play for anybody wanting to really test their detective skills.",positive
Return of the Obra Dinn,"Never thought I'd love naval insurance investigation so much. Having completed the game just now, I feel nostalgic for a time I had never lived through. So strong an impression it has made. As you put the pieces of the puzzle together, the crew and their fates won't let you stop looking for more clues, more pieces to find, assemble and reassemble, to make sense of what had happened. The old monochrome art design works so well you almost smell the ocean, feel the rain, and the horror, too. An absolute gem of a game.",positive
Return of the Obra Dinn,"Me and my wife played this game together and both loved it. Great game, cool look, great mechanics and an interesting and surprising story. The loop of finding who killed who, or ever who this or that guy is really keeps you interested and kept us talking about the game even when we were playing.",positive
Return of the Obra Dinn,"The best detective/murder mystery game ever made. Please do yourself a favor and DON'T brute force answers by blindly guessing without good evidence, because it REALLY cheapens the experience. (I wish brute forcing wasn't so easy in this game.)",positive
Return of the Obra Dinn,"Return of the Obra Dinnis still, to this day, the best detective game ever made, and it is definitely Lucas Pope's Magnum Opus, so even if he never makes any new games ever again, this will still be his great last hurrah. I do hope Lucas releases something new though, because we need more unique and amazingly written games like Obra Dinn.Return of the Obra Dinnis a story about a ship that was lost at sea, then suddenly found. You play as the chief inspector who gotta evaluated the damages and stuff, and in the same time you will have to solve just what the hell happened on this ship. And you do this using a pocketwatch. A pocketwatch that sends you to the moment of someone's death when used on the body, or even a body part... Or even less.This whole game is about finding the pieces that fit and trying to put them together, and you usually won't be sure if you are right or wrong because the game requires Three Correct Guesses to confirm, but when it happens... Oh, the euphoria. And not just from the process of solving, but also the brilliant music accompanying it. The whole soundtrack is PERFECTION, it needs to be heard even outside the game. However, together with the visuals, they both make the game... Incredibly stylish, even in its 1/2-bit graphical look that resembles the OLD PCs of the day, like original Macintosh computers. It's pure joy to look at, to listen to and to solve the mystery.Unfortunately, since it's a detective game, it's... well, non-replayable, unless you forget everything about the story. But it's fine, it's like a rare delicacy that is expensive and you can only allow yourself incredibly rarely, but it's worth it, even if you're only gonna have it once in your life.",positive

Return of the Obra Dinn,"I played this game in short weekly increments with my Mom! Even though we live half a continent away from each other, I streamed it on Discord and she took notes. This was a great game for bouncing ideas off each other, and the slow, exploratory pace meant that it was fine if we got a little off-topic or started chatting.Having just finished it now, we were both really impressed by how many different types of clues and logic may be necessary, and deeply satisfied by the gameplay loop. Story was compelling, and the mechanics highly intriguing. Would recommend playing it solo, too, but hey! If you've got a mystery enthusiast in your life, maybe this is your sign to get into contact with them and spend some quality time!",positive
Return of the Obra Dinn,"Product received for freeThis game was a gift by a friend, so I didn't pay for it. Nevertheless, I would pay for it now that I know what it is.Return of the Obra Dinn is a mystery puzzle game. The premise is this:The year is 1807. You're an insurance investigator and you were commissioned to search and assess the damages of the Obra Dinn; a ship that was deemed missing by the East India Company in 1803. The ship is outside the port of Falmouth and has no visible crew. To aid you in the assessment, you were given a book and a pocket watch with a skull engraved on it named Memento Mortem; no ordinary pocket watch, for sure.What unfolds is a brilliantly told tale of a sea tragedy. I wish I could say more without spoiling the most brilliant of the plot and delivery but, alas, it's impossible. Thus, I recommend you find out for yourself. If puzzles and deductive reasoning are your thing, if you like the minimalistic aesthetic of games and monitors of the late 80s, if you like the stories and myths of the sea, this game is for you.",positive
Return of the Obra Dinn,"An excellent game. Smart âclues and eliminationâ puzzle presented in dramatic still scenes of death (I wonder how they'd look in VR â doesn't seem like it'll be very demanding, too), but also quite a moving tightly-woven story of a naval journey gone very wrong. Causes of death range from an illness, loose cargo accidents, cannon misfire, greed, misunderstanding toâ¦ well, more weird stuff.The game is short, the story is simple, but all of this is to keep the different facts manageable. Various clues are possible to hold in your head (I used my notepad to figure out different Chinese crew members, the rest was OK), and the characters eventually become recognisable on sight.Also I have to say â the sound design and music are outstanding. From the credits I understood it was all done by the sole developer (except for the voices, which are also great in the English version), to which I say â amazing work.PS This game made me feel really stupid at times. I don't blame it.",positive
Return of the Obra Dinn,"An excellent deduction game. I was always either confident of my answers being correct, or at least that I was making a sound educated guess. At no point did I feel like I was making a random choice or a stab in the dark.

Return of the Obra Dinn,"Reviewing Outer Wilds recently really got me thinking about beautiful puzzle elements in games, and how games with incredible detail are often pushed beyond the barrier ofgreatinto the realm ofimpeccable. Return of the Obra Dinn is one of such games. In a year where Iâve played more incredible games than I can count on both of my hands, Lucas Popeâs sublime follow up to Papers, Please stands out as one of the very best.In a despicably sad tale of greed, corruption, mythology, and grief, you, an insurance agent sent to a ship littered with corpses in 1807, have to solve the fates of all 60 members of the Obra Dinn, whether they died or disappeared. It is anincredibly uniquesettingalready, and even though this premise becomes clear just minutes after the game begins, itâsnot even the first unique thing about it. Right from the get-go, Obra Dinn has such striking visual brilliance. It is thematically appropriate, distinct, memorable, and somehow both simplistic yet detailed enough for you to do everything you need to. And when I sayâdetailed enoughâI really cannot even begin to express just how many beautiful details are in this game.Obra Dinn is one of the most detail-laden games Iâve ever played, and itâs all absolutely critical to gameplay. Games of this type lend to brute-forcing the puzzles when stuck, but Lucas Pope has just done amagnificentjob to ensure thatâs both 1) undesirable & unnecessary and 2) extremely hard. Expanding on 2, the sheer number of possibilities for every person (60 crew members, tons of fates, sometimes culprits) makes it a near impossibility, as does the manner by which you must solve 3 fates in order to be confirmed as correct or not. Expanding on 1, there areso manyways to tell who is who at any given time. Locations, relationships, accents, motivations, fates, outfits, and even more, all create set-pieces which are richer than a wedding cake with information to digest. On top of that, I know from experience that sometimes multiple fates are accepted for members of the ship where things are just a little bit too ambiguous. Wonderful.I just want to reiterate though howincrediblethe set-pieces are in Obra Dinn, though. The way you get the black screen with text and audio, which then abruptly gives way to manyjaw-droppingscenes is just perfection. And there is justso muchto see. You could look at these scenes 5 times and find something new every single time you look. Beautiful sound design both in the voice-acting (some of the best voice acting in a game maybe ever?) and in the soundtrack departments lend to some incredibly unforgettable moments, much to the chagrin of players like myself whoso desperatelywish they could go back and play this game again as if they couldnât remember a thing.Return of the Obra Dinn has only one major flaw in my eyes, and that is that the final chapter which you are presented, which is intended to link everything in the plot together, is ultimately uneventful and unfulfilling in my eyes. I know others will not agree with me, but I canât really see how. No matter how I parse it, based on the clues in the story I was already shown, I knew how things were going down and what the deal was. Considering just how jaw-dropping and astonishing many of the reveals in Return of the Obra Dinn can be, it was a bit of a let-down.Along with Outer Wilds, Obra Dinn is a game I havenât been able to stop thinking about since I beat it, and listen to its soundtrack maybe once per day since. Itâs incredibly memorable, so unique, and just so wonderfully executed in so many ways. Itâs a game I have to recommend to anybody, and best played as blind as possible.9.0/10",positive
Return of the Obra Dinn,"Hatâs off to Lucas Pope (the sole creator) for creating/making this awesome game that offers a unique experience. We need more creators like Lucas Pope who could bring a fresh/new perspective in the gaming industry. Now as for the game; If you prefer/have a knack for the following, then buy the game immediately. No second thought!+Interested in solving mysteries and deduce puzzles.+Love Sea life and Horror Themes+Interest in solving crime mysteries+Time travel.+Love games that will not hold your hand; rather will push you to your limit in terms of thinking capability and observation.+Love games that offer only âone timeâ experienceDo not buy the game if-You do not like too much backtracking.- You are impatience.-After seeing the graphics and colour schemes in the store page, you feel that they are not suitable for your vision or to the eye.OverviewA gem of a game having unique mechanic which will force you to think out of the hat. Good Observation skill, analytical skill, deduction skill and patience are the four essential characteristics or attribute that the gamer/player need to possess so that they can appreciate what the game has to offer.It will take around 7-8 hours or more (depending on the playerâs skillâs) to finish the game. You have to backtrack a lot to find clues and hints that can help you solve the mysteries.The game will offer a âone-time experienceâ and it will be an experience worth remembering.Plot and MechanicThe player takes the role of an âinsurance inspectorâ who is sent to discover the incidents and what happened with the shop named âObra dinâ and its crew members. The ship has been lost near the Canarian island for many years and it is up to the inspector (the player) as what really happened (or should I say tragedy) to the ship. The player or the inspector will be possessing a diary and a magical stopwatch that can help the player time travel. The player will be using the stopwatch mostly to âtime travelâ back in the past. The player will be taken to past scenes/incidents that had occurred in the ship way back. Basically, the watch will allow the player when they are near a corpse/dead body to travel back in time and observe that dead personâs last living memory or the incident that had killed that person. The player needs to critically observe the surroundings and environment near the dead body and deduce or analyze the incident that lead to the personâs demise. The player had to revisit memories or go back in time a lot of times before making a judgement and making a prediction as what happened to that person. A total of 60 fates of victims (reason of death, the murderers etc) need to be solved. The difficult/challenging part is that the player had to look for clues and other factors to deduce the names of the victim also.Sound and MusicBoth sound and Music are excellent and it will offer a feeling of satisfaction to the player. Not once in my playthrough I ever felt boredom due to the excellent music. The sound and music match the environment and the theme perfectly.Graphics and GameplayQuite innovative and provide a comical style/art. The player controls the inspector/investigator in first person who moves around the ship investing corpses and travel back in time (with the stopwatch) to relive the final moments of that dead person. The player will also take notes about the incidents like the âcause of death, victim name, attacker name etc.Overall and RecommendationsThis game will allow the player in appreciating their own intelligence.  Once a player is able to solve the mystery, they will feel accomplished. It offers a unique experience. While some players can identify the discrepancies during a memory scene, others can be focused towards highlighting the murdered and gather key details during the first glance itself. All the player needs to do is concentrate, stay focus, critically analyze each murder scene or memories and deduce the mystery output. Some puzzles can be too difficult to solve but if the player gain interest in the game then it is almost certain that the player will not abandon or leave the game till, they solve all the mysteries.My Rating9.5/10. Absolutely Recommended.",positive
Return of the Obra Dinn,"This game is a mix between two things: applying logic based on sparing evidence to piece together a narrative, and blind guesswork. Don't get me wrong, it's an incredibly fun experience that is more than worth your money, but you should know going into it that at a certain point your deductive reasoning will give way to metagaming the mechanics.Many scenes are intentionally devoid of evidence that would allow you to figure out the names and fates of the crew mates featured therein, the idea being that you would use context clues and intuition to fill in the blanks. That's not really how it ends up playing out, though. More than likely you'll narrow it down to a group of 3-4 different dudes and then randomly apply names and fates until something clicks. The game somewhat encourages you to do this, but it broke immersion more than I'd like.But y'know what? I'm a big dumbass. If you're reading this and considering buying this game then there's a good chance that you're already smarter than me. Maybe you can flex your intuitive muscles and fill in the blanks without a random application of the game's mechanics. Good for you, you egghead nerd.But let's say you can't. Let's say you're just an oafish moron like me. You should still buy the game. It's a ride that you won't get anywhere else and you really would be an idiot to pass up on the opportunity.",positive
Return of the Obra Dinn,"I am not one to post reviews on here but in this case I absolutely had to.I have always loved mysteries and detective gameplay, not to mention stories of existential horror and calamity, so combining those with an old-school monochrome display? Absolute genius.I really cannot think of any other game that handles mystery-solving gameplay in this manner and this well, putting even the best, most classic games in the genre to shame. It's even a fantastic logic puzzle of sorts.The only thing I can compare this game to is actually a board game - Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective. That game uses text entries and an extensive map system based upon 19th Century London to allow observant players to follow a trail of clues to solve a crime and if desired several smaller mysteries along the way.This is better because the challenge is never in finding any of the pieces per se but rather how they fit together and provide clues to each other across time and space. It's sheer genius, and I hope more developers take notice and use similar systems to produce great mystery games.If I were to criticize anything, it's that perhaps the story is not technically *that* original, but there's enough crazy developments, hidden details, and graphic detail to make up for that.",positive
Return of the Obra Dinn,"I don't think any other single playthrough has left as strong an impression on me as this.

An incredibly captivating experience.",positive
Return of the Obra Dinn,"Such a great game and experience. Based around a clever ideia, it's extremely rewarding to find all the pieces of the story and deduce the final outcome.

Return of the Obra Dinn,"This is a fantastic game, but I wouldn't recommend it to everyone. It requires a lot of patience and it takes a little while to get the hang of the mechanics. This is partly due to some of the menus being a little clunky (for example, it takes something like 3 clicks / button presses just to open the map, which I used a LOT). A few quality of life improvements would go a long way here.That said, once you get into the swing of things, this is a brilliantly satisfying puzzle / deduction game, and I've never played anything quite like it! The unusual graphical style might put some people off, but I think it suits the game perfectly. The game is very cleverly designed so that the plot and crucial clues are revealed subtly and gradually, and cannot be easily brute-forced (although there is an element of guesswork at times).One thing I would have liked to see is the ability to add custom notes about memories / crew members.",positive
Return of the Obra Dinn,"Return of the Obra Dinn has everything I wanted in a good detective game; an intriguing mystery that pulls you in quickly, challenging puzzles with no hand-holding for awesome discoveries, impactful moments that completely change your perspective in a matter of seconds, really good sound design and a GREAT soundtrack!The only thing some people could find jarring is the art style, but honestly I found it a delight to look at. If you instead don't like the colors, there are options to change the colors.I can now see why people who've played my favorite game, Outer Wilds on Youtube often go to this game next, as it really feels like a spiritual successor to that one. If you've instead played this game first, I highly recommend you to check out Outer Wilds!",positive

Return of the Obra Dinn,"Return of the Obra Dinn is a detective game where you have to pay attention to every single little detail to piece everything together. Not many detective games manage to pull of what Obra Dinns succeeds to do: making the player do the actual detective work. When playing through this game, you'll find yourself having an ""aha!"" moment very often.",positive
Return of the Obra Dinn,"Lost at seaIn 1802, the Obra Dinn embarks from England on a long voyage to Asia, carrying 51 crewmates and 9 passengers. In 1807, the ship reappears in Falmouth, England, this time devoid of life and filled to the brim withdeath. You are given a notebook/journal and a rather mysterious pocket watch and you are tasked with identifying 60 people and reporting on their individual fates.Return of the Obra Dinn is an explorative walking sim where you find yourself in the boots of an unnamed inscurance investigator, hired by the East India Trade Company to find out what happened to the ship and the people aboard it. It is one of the best games in the detective/mystery puzzle genre and personally one of the best games I've played in general.Aboard the Obra DinnA Screenshot of Return of the Obra DinnBy:The Crusading BurnerProcess of eliminationThe game's investigative premise is simple: there are 60 people registered aboard the Obra Dinn. You have to pinpoint everyone's name and face and what their fate is. It's easy to deduct some fates while others will require careful sleuthing to get them right. You can definitely make wrong deductions, especially in the larger, packed scenes. Another beautiful feature of the game is that you will not be notified immediately if your assessment concerning a person's identity and fate is correct. Instead, this only happens in batches of 3 correct answers. This process makes it more difficult to use multiple-choices guesswork which is already a hard thing, since there are 60 individuals. Keep in mind that you can finish the game with wrong answers or no answers at all.There are many visual and audio cues that help the player understand what happened in each scene. The story is split into various chapters, from the very start of the voyage until its conclusion and the titles are indicative of what happened during those events or what it's going to be transpired as you piece together the puzzle. The chapters also lay out the timeline of the ship's voyage. The final chapter is revealed only after concluding the investigation.Who is this man? And what's his fate?A Screenshot of Return of the Obra DinnBy:The Crusading BurnerMemento MortemYou examine the remains of those who died and by seeing the moment of their death, as well as the circumstances surrounding it, you can extrapolate some valuable information such as the identity of the person who died, their manner of death and who was around them during that event, as well as what those particular people were caught up doing in that very instance. These moments have not yet beinglost in time like tears in rainbut remain frozen, likemacabre vignettes, for you, the unsuspecting insurance investigator to analyze and scrutinize over, in hope of shedding light to the rather bleak events that took place upon the Obra Dinn.These vignettes unravel in a way that is oozing grandieur, with bombastic music themes exploding as the scene appears, while also invoking an ominous feeling. It's really a clever design with my only gripe being that it's a bit annoying when you can't figure out some aspects of the investigation and so you have to go through the scenes over and over again. However, it is certainly a feature that doesn't overstay its welcome since that momentary feeling of annoyance is negated by the next upcoming grand reveal, with each clue discovered being a dose of adrenaline and bringing you one step closer to the truth. Thateuphoric feeling of pieces falling into placeis definitely the game's focal point.A beautiful and unique art styleA Screenshot of Return of the Obra DinnBy:The Crusading BurnerPart of the ship, part of the crewThe art style of the game is simultaneously old school and avant-garde. The use of retro Macintosh graphics rendering in a fully 3D environment makes the visual aspect of Obra Dinn unique. Many of the deaths are brutal, not only in their depiction of gore: the gurgles, death rattles, and guttural sounds are all giving a vibrant and terrifying touch of realism. It's amazing how the game offers this visceral experience while being so limited by its visual presentation.It's imperative to experience the Obra Dinn's mystery plot without exposure to spoilers since once you know the details of what went down it's inevitable to not lose interest in playing the game yourself. I can't stress enough how important is revealing with your own research what happened aboard the ship and gradually unveiling the obsure and horrifying events that took place upon the ship. It is an one of a kind experience that I can recommend easily to any fan of the detective/mystery genre and strongly suggest to anyone looking to play something dissimilar to conventional puzzle games.",positive
Return of the Obra Dinn,"Simply one of the best games I have played all year. It is a detective-style game that actually makes you think about the decisions you make as it is much harder to guess than it is to deduce. The gameplay is gratifying and the story is fantastic.

Return of the Obra Dinn,"This game is one of a kindâand it is perfect. It features great, catchy visual style (which you can tweak to look like various old computer displays) as well as sound design (the soundtrack is awesome and voice acting is on top: there are characters who speak with a certain accent depending on where they come from, or just speak foreign languages, and it is all masterfully executedâand localized!), has notably distinct pace and gameplay compared to other detective games (in such a way that you are presented with final moments of peopleâs lives and have to identify them and deduce their fate instead of the other way around) andâmost importantlyâit tellsa truly extraordinary story. Sometimes I wonder how Lucas Pope (the author of this game) managed to create such a narrative and tie the fates of 61 people together in a way that makes it interesting, challenging and rewarding to solve. It feels like a movie or a book that, upon finishing it, leaves a feeling that you wonât watch or read something like that ever again. There is one word to describe this game, and that word is âmasterpieceâ.âReturn of the Obra Dinnâ is one of those pieces of art that will make you want to erase your memory just so you can experience it for the first time once again.

Return of the Obra Dinn,"Return of the Obra Dinn is one of those rare games that gripped from me beginning to end. It is, at it's very base, a logic puzzle. But the way that this logic puzzle unfolds and is solved is both engaging and incredibly satisfying. One of those rare games that truly make the ""aha!"" moments feel clever.Pros:- The graphic style, while minimalistic, is beautifully done. Every scene is painstakingly crafted and the creator did an amazing job relaying information with static 3D scenes.- The game design. I'm not really sure how to expand on that without giving too much away, but the entire game feels very well thought out. There's not a lot of redundant information, no side quests, nothing to distract you. The game, for lack of a better analogy, feels like a beautifully wrapped gift, with each layer carefully planned.- FIGURING STUFF OUT - This is the big one. As I mentioned previously, at it's heart this is simply a giant logic puzzle. But, the key to deciphering all of the identities and fates of the crew of the Obra Dinn is a multi-faceted one. You will have to make logical deductions, as well as logical leaps, using information as specific as a name to information as miniscule as somebody's footwear. There is a wealth of information in the scenes that may not be immediately apparent. NOBODY NEEDS TO BE GUESSED. There is something, somewhere, that will tell you who they are, if you can only figure it out.- The story! I wasn't expecting much of one and while the Return of the Obra Dinn doesn't have an amazingly moving one it is a thoroughly entertaining one. The narrative, confusing at first, becomes increasingly clear as you progress and lays out a very strange, yet familiar tale.- The UI, insofar as being useful. I felt like I was given the tools I needed to continue uncovering the mysteries of the Obra Dinn without feeling like I was being guided heavily along.Cons:- I did not care for the mandatory wait time between entering a scene and beginning to enter information regarding it's focus. I understand that it was an artistic choice and that it allowed for studying the scene before jumping to conclusions, but in the end it just became a waiting game to continue playing.- It would have been nice, even if just at the end of the game, to be able to jump directly into scenes without having to track down bodies. I understand that exploring the ship is important even after all the death scenes have been explored, as there are small clues all over the place. However, having to trek from one deck to another as I completed the last half of the book was laborious.Conclusion:I love this game. It was an amazingly satisfying experience that I wish I could repeat. It has some small flaws, but overall, if you enjoy a good logic puzzle then play this game.",positive
Return of the Obra Dinn,"A genuinely magical game thatâs kept me thinking about it and will continue having this grip on me for quite some time. Games that utilise the medium to such an extent that their identity hinges on the interactive element being present are some of the most fun ones to let sit with you, and this is one of my favourite instances of it. Return of the Obra Dinn is one of the greatest mystery games Iâve played and a lot of this is owed to the structure of the game, forgoing crafting a mystery specifically designed to surprise the player with its various twists and instead laying it all out bare and forcing you to pick everything apart to fully grasp the finer details of things. The mystery and story themselves are not the important aspects here, itâs just trying to immerse you into the role of a detective without any handholding beyond the bare essentials, and it does so perfectly.Return of the Obra Dinn is a mystery/puzzle game that revolves around incomplete information and assumption, often leaving little to no definitive evidence and forcing you to jump all around to place with increasingly tenuous lines of logic as you feel yourself going insane. It was quite funny taking a step back after combing through a few scenes in excruciating detail and just thinking âwow, this is derangedâ but thatâs just how the game is. The player is likely to find all of the story beats of the game rather early on without knowing the fates of the vast majority of the cast, and then the rest of the game boils down to going between the relevant scenes in the game to try and figure out how to deduce some of them, which would seem like an experience that would feel stagnant very quickly, but is saved due to the sense of progression that will take place despite it all just looking like cleanup at first. The progression gates in this game are entirely dependent on and driven by the player, hinging on multiple big realisations on how they need to approach their investigations. This culminates in a deeply rewarding loop of thinking that youâve hit the logical endpoint of what you achieve on your own, before realising a new detail that leads you down a new line of logic to discover someone, and then applying this newfound understanding of how to figure something out to other characters. A contributing factor to how this is so successful is due to the plethora of approaches that youâre expected to work out, sometimes really being as simple but uncertain feeling as âthis guy hangs around this other guy a lot, theyâre probably in the same fieldâ.The way that your answers are confirmed is a clever way of limiting the ability to brute force a lot of puzzle answers as well, since youâve only got confirmation on whether youâre correct or not once you have 3 correct answers simultaneously written down. While some amount of guesswork was an expected element of this gameâs design, by structuring it like this, players are still forced to confidently deduce 2 other people before they can start taking real shots in the dark with incomplete assumptions, solving a problem Iâve seen time and time again in deduction games where people will often resort to total guesswork the moment theyâre met with some confusion and uncertainty. The presentation goes a long way in tying everything together as well, being visually striking while having the effect of being simple enough to make the important details easier to pinpoint while simultaneously obscuring everything just enough to invite uncertainty into every observation. I adore whenever a game can keep me thinking for so long after Iâm done with it, and I love it even more when it does so through something as esoteric as it is here. Total masterpiece, something new to add to my list of favourites.10/10",positive
Return of the Obra Dinn,One of the best singleplayer games i've ever played. The game drags you in as you try to figure out what happened on the ship. Putting the pieces together felt intuitive and often required you to be very observant. I went in thinking I would get bored or it might get tedious. At no point of the game was I bored and every revelation made was extremely satisfying and rewarding. 10/10. Wish I could rewind time and play it again with no knowledge.,positive
Return of the Obra Dinn,"Really enjoyed my time with Return of the Obra Dinn. The mystery story unfolds in a very interesting and unique way. One assumes the role of an insurance investigator who boards the abandoned trading vessel Obra Dinn to unravel what went down. With regards to the game-play and it's time dynamics, I must admit I was puzzled for quite a while before understanding how it worked. It is, in a good way, quite demanding and requires that one picks up on details to move the investigation forward. On top of this, the graphics style, the voice acting and the reactive soundtrack further elevates the experience. I clocked in at almost 16 hours apparently, but then I left the game idling for some periods, so I would not say the game is too long. All in all, like the equally great 'Papers, Please', Return of the Obra Dinn feels like a labor of love. Well done, Lucas Pope!",positive
Return of the Obra Dinn,"Don't do what I did, avoid all spoilers. Don't even look tips up, and brute forcing answers is theoretically doable but highly discouraged.A logic/mystery/detective game where every small detail genuinely matters, there were moments in this game where I literally  jumped out of my chair snapped my fingers in excitement after realising I worked something out. It's great. I'll be chasing that high for a long time.A beautiful and tragic tale set in the age of mercantilism, the story of the Obra Dinn is a story about desperation, colonialism, greed. Of subtle commentaries of society and forces beyond human ken.",positive
YU-NO: A girl who chants love at the bound of this world,"This is the hardest negative review I've ever written. While I can appreciate how groundbreaking and influential this game was, it does not hold up well today. I never played the original, so this is a straight review without comparisons.The first act - which has branching timelines, uses the save/load mechanic as a narrative tool, and lets the player collect and use items to alter outcomes - is legitimately pretty cool. However, it's far from perfect, bogged down by bad pacing and writing. The translation is widely considered very poor, which doesn't help. Regardless, it is quite rambling and needed an aggressive editor. After dialogue I was often thinking, ""They could have cut that by a third without losing anything."" Character stupidity drives much of the drama, which wears thin.In the game's second act, the time travel thriller story/mechanics are dropped completely, and the main character is cut off from the cast and locations of the first act. This abrupt disconnect almost ruins the game, and my investment immediately evaporated. I only kept going for the sake of finishing. It was not worth it. The plot isn't *awful* but it does not come together in a satisfying way, and leaves many details unexplained. When I was done, I just stopped thinking about the game. It left no lasting impression.Progression is frequently random - good luck finding the right location, item, or interaction point to advance the story. The game has a hint system which helps enormously, and I would consider it mandatory. I resisted the hint system for a long time and my playtime is probably 2X as long as a result. Per the above, not time well spent.I'm being hard on the game, so let's go over the positives. The game has a TON of CGs, many backgrounds, and (mostly) good character sprites. There are often minor animations which add a very nice touch. In this respect it blows most other VNs out of the water. The music (which can be toggled between remake and original) is also of high quality. The game is fully voiced, which is impressive given the sheer volume of dialogue. I can't fault it for a lack of content, effort, or polish (except for the English translation).The first act was enjoyable overall, and teasing apart the mysteries across various branching routes was a good experience. For this, we owe YU-NO much, as it advanced the VN genre by light-years. But bad writing, uneven pacing, frustrating progression/game design, and the disconnected, dull second act which robs the conclusion of any impact, means there are simply better games to spend your time. If you want to play YU-NO out of historical interest, wait for a steep discount. But you'd probably be better off with the original, in that case.",negative
YU-NO: A girl who chants love at the bound of this world,"The remake is trash. Yes, they did update ADMS to be more accessible and easy to use. Yes, they did highlight the objects to make them more easy to target and included an in-game walkthrough to make it easier to get through the story for new players. Still, beyond these accessibility features, everything else is much worse.The ain selling point of the game is its plot, its art and its atmosphere (including godly soundtrack) working together. Out of the three, the only part that mostly didn't suffer was the soundtrack due to the fact we can simply choose to use the original one, even if compression makes its notes quite a bit duller.However, the plot is rewritten in several places when it makes them worse, and is no longer supported by the game art. (the translation outright censoring sex jokes that are key to the protagonist's character are an issue of English localization specifically, but not the game itself)You see, Takuya references Freud in one of his first spoken lines in the game (the very first one in the original game, IIRC). It happens for a reason - our protagonist's biggest defining trait is Oedipus complex. Every single heroine we see reminds him of motherhood in one way or another: Ayumi being his step-mother, several other girls being directly connected to his dad, Mitsuki being a stand-in for Ayumi [s](who also was a student in love with her teacher just like Mitsuki was when they started dating)[/s] and Kanna literally giving him ""the same feeling he felt when near his mother"", explained in ""The Other World"" Arc. Our boy is not just ""walking libido"" (another trait of Oedipus complex, by the way) - he's a MILF hunter. Making every single girl in the story look younger completely destroys our view of protagonist - they are all busty and mature-looking precisely because Takuya's attention doesn't even register other kinds of women.And now to get to the art. Seeing is believing. Let me post a pair of links to the screenshots I took and posted on Discord:https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1064191550554382336/1064263401209090218/image.pnghttps://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1064191550554382336/1082596381736325150/image.pngIt's a crime to draw women's breasts like that in a story about a boy craving mother's embrace.",negative

YU-NO: A girl who chants love at the bound of this world,Product refundedDO NOT BUY THIS GAME!The game currently has a lot of issues which makes it unplayable. The issue I'm personally experiencing is that the game breaks down and is unable to proceed after a certain point in the prologue. Several others have reported this issue as well. Meaning you literally can't play any more than the prologue until that issue is fixed.Another issue I've seen reported a lot is that the game refuses to install and only install the digital art book.The customer support is also very unresponsive. I highly suggest you wait before buying this game until they've actually fixed the major issues and makes it playable.,negative
YU-NO: A girl who chants love at the bound of this world,"i can definitely see why this game was important. definitely, the mechanic by which you explore the main story is cool ans the rules that govern it in the story are all really cool and consistent. i can see how this would have influenced other works.but in terms of writing this is an absolute mess that doesn't hold up lmao. the main story is alright, but most of the last 10 hours is like a fanfiction that was glued on to the main story, where the author tried jamming a billion new things into the story to create a hilarious mixed bag of clever things and insultingly dumb things.there's also a few things that happen at the end that are quite gross and morally questionable.can i recommend this? not sure. depends on how much you can enjoy poor writing. I enjoyed playing around with the map in the main story, and was in absolute amazement watching that hilarious true ending unfold.up to you. i'll put a not recommend just because",negative
YU-NO: A girl who chants love at the bound of this world,"Product refundedThere is a version 23 years ago that's 10 billion percent better than this. I would daresay the anime is better, too. The translation has been localized (which is dumb, because the internet is an open space; nationalism is how you break that key factor of social media), the art has been watered down (design is 50-50, but a lot less flair than the original, and the limiting icons to show choices ruins any incentive for mystery (because even things hidden inside the game have been revealed), and even the marketing is awful, where unfortunate sojourners and cultural embracers alike find themselves spoiled before they could even finish downloading the game; you're not supposed to know what the younger version of the elf looks like, much less the fact that she is an elf first thing - along with an artbook that reveals several plot points and absolutely has to be downloaded along with the game. I would like to add a review to forewarn others and both Spike Chunsoft and MAGES. about this, as these practices to other visual novels will damage future reworks and classics like this one; you can read the legacy tab on ""kono yo no hate de koi wo utau shoujo: YU-NO"" in the wiki and realize how disrespectful this work is. It will not matter if this is not allowed anyway, as there are other ways to critique a game; do as the regulations can accept.If you can manage to find a company that will directly bring the original version to Steam, then please allow it (and make sure that they also allow others to test the game to the absolute (and make sure that it contains those who really enjoy this game, like me and the people at ""Do Yourself A Favor And..."" discussion). This will also go for any visual novels in particular, especially from companies with a reputation of localizing as well as translating text. no one wants jelly filled donuts on their happiness.I hear that there is a way to refund this game before an hour of playing it, so let's get this over with asap. I wish this can be an eye opener to other translators in any form of entertainment. Thank you in advance (unless if the refund doesn't pass, because that is a lot of money for a visual novel in steam (the most expensive, too)).-Sent to Steam Support to Refund this game",negative
YU-NO: A girl who chants love at the bound of this world,"I'm basing this review on the remake alone, if you feel the points I make are not there in the original then feel free to ignore it. The game was ambitious for its time in fact too ambitious, I can see why people like this and I myself like it to some extent. If you want a murder mystery, this isn't it, chief.Story: 5/10 I have absolutely no problems with the story in the first part of the game the problem arise when I went to thetrue ending, that ending felt drawn out and was more emotional than anything. I felt the story went into a genre shift at that part that was too abrupt at least imo. I wouldn't have disliked it as much if Takuya the main character had any character development, but he did not. I'll explain more about his character in more depth in the character points.Characters: 3/10 The only characters that even have any redeeming qualities were Eriko, Mitsuki, Mio and Kanna.Takuya which is the main character that we're stuck with throughout the whole game NEVER (this is important) NEVER had any character development. Throughout the story we see him see people die, forgive people, punched people and we never see him do those things again in the true route. They baited you into thinking that Takuya might be onto something in Kaori's route since he knew that Kaori was a corporate spy, but no, they just had to make Takuya the human trash that he is in the true ending. Sorry if you like Takuya but he's an irredeemable guy. He's not the worse MC I've seen but he's pretty close. Ayumi his mom was also the same, their mother-son relationship is forced as hell and uncomfortable sorry but her route was really uncomfortable to go through. I would say more bad things about Ayumi but It's been a while since I finished her route so my memory is quite hazy, I just remember disliking her because of her trust in Takuya and what she did.Music: 8/10 Every music in the game was nice to listen to, this was one thing i can say the game had good marks on all the way through. When it was tense, the music was tense and when it was heartwarming so was the music. Music was really good.Gameplay: 5/10 you cant even call this gameplay but this was from an era where this type of point and click was popular, they did try to make it bearable with the icons and stuff. My main issue was the puzzle atthe clock how the hell were people suppose to know to press 6 and 3. Hiding the puzzle in the game story was one thing but in the opening? that's straight up bullcrap. I had to spend 3 hours trying to find every nook and cranny of the map.Overall I would not recommend this game simply because of the genre shift they did, if you came here for mystery murder just like me. Avoid this game like the plague, it's not that at all. I can see why people would like this, but I just cannot, I try to but I just can't. The music was solid but that was it. The story used the carrot dangling method a bit way too much. They drip feed you answers in each route but barely any that makes sense, even in thetrue route, you have to read another 4-5 hours of stuff to get to any decent answers and at that point I knew I just can't take the pacing anymore.",negative
YU-NO: A girl who chants love at the bound of this world,"I generally don't give negative reviews, since I tend to very quickly quit games that I don't enjoy playing. I forced myself to play this game because I heard a lot of buzz from a lot of people about how great it is, and honestly, I should have learned in middle school not to give into peer pressure, because I really regret playing this game.The gameplay of this game is composed of two core mechanics: clicking on elements in the environment to find information, and reading through character dialogue. In both of these vectors the game is nigh unplayable.Let's start with dialogue, since that's what you spend the most time in. Character dialogue is unimaginably bloated, and this is not helped by the fact that the MC never actually contributes to dialogue. He is like a robot that randomly simulates the dialogue of a seven-year-old, and honestly, most other characters aren't much better. Because of this, only one out of every ten lines of dialogue ends up being worth reading. I'm not exaggerating, and as an example, let's discuss a point in the game where a character A tells the MC that another character B has gone missing. In normal dialogue, this would take at most three lines, as follows:---A: Hey, Main Character, there's an emergency!MC: A? What happened?A: B has gone missing!---In Yu-no, this dialogue, from ""Hey, Main Character"" to ""B has gone missing!"" is TWENTY-NINE lines. 29. And what occurs during this dialogue? Here's an excerpt.---MC: So what's the big deal?A: It's Mio. I just stopped by her house.MC: And?A: Mio's house is really big.MC: Yeah, it is... Her father is a prominent person in Sakaimachi.A: I'm not talking about that!MC: What are you talking about, then?A: Not the house, her room.MC: I'm sure that's just as big.A: Well, yes.---Remember, this is *just one-third* of the dialogue that occurs in the space between ""Hey, Main Character"" and ""B has gone missing!"". I get the sense that the writers were going for some kind of comedic effect by making dialogue this meaninglessly meandering-- maybe this kind of dialogue was funny in 1996, I don't know. Other reviews have criticized the ""English translation"" for their bad reading experiences, but I can assure you that the English translation is not hiding some meaningful philosophical discussion in these 29 lines. The writing just sucks.The second core mechanic of this game is clicking on elements in the environment to see the MC's thoughts on them. There are, roughly speaking, three types of results that occur:Click on a rock -> ""That's a rock. It's bigger than the other rock.""Click on a rock for the tenth time, after clicking on all seven rocks in the area at least five times -> ""Oh, huh, I just noticed that there's a secret passage behind this rock.""Click on a woman's breasts or crotch or lips, etc -> ""Whoa mama! Hummina hummina hummina bazooooooooing! *eyes pop out* AROOOOOOOOGA!""Later games in this genre are much better with this mechanic, but Yu-no is so insufferable with it that there were many times where I had to turn the skip feature on and spam-click things in order to make it through the tedium of activating the tenth-time-rock-click trigger for game progression. Be warned that this mechanic doesn't gate progression too often during the main game, but during the true route (which is about a third of the game length), you have to do a tenth-time-rock-click trigger once every several minutes, and very often you have to do them in succession.To top it off, the story, with all its branching paths and time travel shenanigans, doesn't actually build to anything. The true route takes some of the characters from the main game and sticks them in a utterly nonsensical and unrelated setting, as if it's a crossover of itself with a generic isekai anime. This ending is unique in that it manages to logically resolve all the remaining plot threads without emotionally resolving them. In other words, while all the questions presented in the first hour of game of ""where's my father?"" ""what's with all the lightning?"" ""what's with that pointy mountain?"" are answered, none of the answers are good. You could probably come up with more interesting answers to these questions by randomly picking words from sci-fi books.In short, this game sucks.",negative
YU-NO: A girl who chants love at the bound of this world,"Product received for freeOne of the very rare negative reviews from me.Got the game from my friend on sale who saw positive reviews and heard good things about this game overall. We wanted to play it together with a group of friends and just chill with cool story etc.Oh boy was that a miss.Game is going the most obnoxious way possible when it comes to ""gameplay""First impressions were cool. I was checking all possible options on the given map and hearing the main character's reactions. It felt good for like an hour. But... after some time most of these custom options stopped giving any meaningful informations at all. There were several times where I could look at the drawer and I was like: ""Hey let's see what is in there"" but instead I only heard a MC saying ""This is a drawer"". And there are a lot of those interactions, plenty of them. They are completely useless and waste player's time.I would not be so mad if at some point in the story you are forced to do the most stupid interactions ever to progress the plot. You are not supposed just to just check every single one out of 15+ useless mc monologues in a single room to progress the story.You have to do the exact sequence of useless mc monologues to progress the plot.Literally you have to look at your window -> bed -> shelf -> desk -> book on a shelf -> shelf -> desk to progress the plot. My god. At that point I had to pull out a guide to proceed further in this game. I have no idea how anyone in this world would've randomly guessed that you are supposed to do that.Not to mention the sequence where I have to molest my own teacher who is stuck at a fence in order to progress the plot by looking  and touching her crotch 6x in a row... INSTEAD OF JUST HELPING HER.Well... and then there I've checked the walkthrough guide... and there's is a lot of those stupid interactions in this game.But hey, maybe the plot isn't so bad?Overall plot idea is interesting. And that's all positives I can say about it. This is a visual novel where you mostly talk with characters. And... uhh.... I've never played a more boring Visual Novel in my life. Most of the time main character is just a horny brat who wants to â¥â¥â¥â¥ anything that moves. He tries his best to be a cool kid with his imagined sunglasses but he ends up being the most annoying character in the whole story. Most of the conversations bring absolutely nothing to the story to the point where I feel like spent 6h out of 9h just on reading meaningless text. I understand that Visual Novels are mostly about those ""meaningless"" conversations between characters but you have to make it interesting in order to work right. Here it doesn't work by any means. All characters I met so far are simply annoying. But maybe I felt this way because they were annoyed by stupidity of the MC.if you enjoy playing a visual novel with a tutorial opened because you are stuck every 30 minutes then yeahhh...Story is ok but all of the character interactions are the most boring thing you will ever encounter in visual novels.The price point for this game makes it even worse. Can't recommend by any means.",negative

There's often no logic to it unlike mystery VNs like Danganronpa/Ace Attorney.  It feels like you just have to look around and occasionally making small talk with someone for an hour until something happens that actually progresses the plot.Beside that, the first section I got through is like 50% the protagonist talking about how he wants to bang his stepmom. I wanted time-travel mysteries, not fetish content.",negative
YU-NO: A girl who chants love at the bound of this world,"I've never written a review before, but here are my thoughts.A. Main character is a massive jerk. And not in a fun way.

Unfortunately that only extends to people he's sexually attracted to, it seems.B. I now know it's an older title, but in a modern context, it just feels terrible overall.C. The reason I actually quit playing: I'm not even 10 hours in, and there have been two jokes that essentially boil down to ""MC sexually harasses a stranger until they tell him they have a â¥â¥â¥â¥ or are trans, at which point MC finds them disgusting and repulsive.""

The House in Fata Morgana,"I don't typically write Steam reviews. Iâve only written one prior to this, and itâs a joke review. However, it's been over two years since my initial playthrough of this game, and frankly, with the impact that Fata Morgana continues to have on me even years after playing, I think I would be doing it a disservice to not share my thoughts on it. This review will be spoiler-free and rather lengthy. I will not be summarizing the plot or giving a neat list of my likes and dislikes, but instead Iâm going to raise a few points that I feel will help potential customers decide whether or not this game is for them.In 2021, there was a period of several weeks where the Switch port of the Fata Morgana collection was the highest rated game of all time on Metacritic. Although a port, this was the first version of the game to get enough critic reviews to receive a rating on the site. Understandably, this made headlines. Many indignant gamers protested than an obscure """"""anime"""""" visual novel couldnevercompare to the likes of Mario and Zelda. Even though it was eventually unseated from its throne and knocked down to a 97, it stands as the second highest rated game to release in 2021.As someone who played Fata Morgana before this influx of media attention, it has been quite interesting to see the reaction that others have to it. Mostly, players can be sorted into two categories. Interestingly enough, I havenât seen many people who have a simply âmehâ reaction to this game. There's the group who claim that this game sucks, often calling it boring, edgy and overrated. And then there's the crowd who praise the game like itâs their child and say that itâs a masterpiece that absolutely deserves its high Metacritic rating. If you haven't figured it out by now, I fit more into the second group. That's not to say that I don't have my issues with the game/series, but overall, I would definitely rank Fata Morgana in my top 3 favorite games of all time, and perhaps #1 in terms of emotional investment.To be quite honest, not everyone will like this game. YOU may not like this game. Before all the hype, I first heard of Fata Morgana from a Youtube comment chain on a certain Pathologic video essay. The comment listed a few examples of excellent games that are not fun to play, and argued that good games do not necessarily have to be 'fun'. I can certainly agree that, at many points, The House in Fata Morgana is not at all fun. It is an absolutely worthwhile experience that does have some humorous moments, but for the majority of your time with it, you will not be laughing, nor will you feel relaxed or warm and fuzzy inside. Is this a negative? For some people, yes. Many players value the escapist nature of video games, and while Fata Morgana will certainly engross you in its narrative, the universe of this game is often just as cruel as the real world. But of course, this isnât a drawback for everyone. In the same way that you don't watch a suspense movie for the comedy or a slasher movie for the romance, you shouldn't buy Fata Morgana with the expectation that itâs a feel-good experience. Itâs hard to pin Fata Morgana down into one genre, but I feel like the Psychological Horror, Drama, and Gothic Horror tags are accurate. Itâs definitely not a dating sim or âerogeâ, and this game is quite different from many of the other Japanese VNs on the market.It seems fairly obvious, but to truly appreciate and 'get' this game, you need to also enjoy reading. I don't mean this in a pretentious Rick and Morty copypasta way. I say it because this is the most 'novel-like' visual novel I have ever played, both narratively and mechanically. Many newer visual novels add extra gameplay systems to spice up the monotony of reading text for hours on end, and without spoiling anything, I will say that Fata Morgana does not do this. You are going to spend your playthrough clicking the enter button and reading text without any voiceover. Again, this is going to be a drawback to some people. However, for players like myself who enjoy literature, this isn't really too much of an issue. I also feel like calling Fata Morgana a glorified book is overly reductive. This game has an absolutely phenomenal soundtrack thatâs on par with games like Nier Automata, and the music paired with the beautifully illustrated sprites and key artwork combines to create a truly memorable experience. Fata Morgana would simply not have the impact that it does if the story was told in the form of a book, but it also bears more similarities to a novel than to an action RPG or FPS game.Finally, I must mention the overall content of the game. Although there are lighthearted moments and plenty of enjoyable characters, at its core, Fata Morgana tells an incredibly heavy and mature story. At various moments, this game will leave you feeling depressed, agonized, hopeless, disgusted, and horrified. There are also lots of potentially triggering topics that arise within the story. In my personal opinion, these topics are (for the most part) handled in a mature and respectful manner, and are not portrayed in an incredibly gratuitous or fetishistic way. There is an official list of content warnings on the Mangagamer website, so I advise anyone who may be sensitive to certain topics to review the list before playing. Be aware that this list does contain spoilers and some limited context for a few of the warnings, but I think the game still has plenty of twists and turns even if you do read the list. With that being said, please note that this game is not ALL doom and gloom. Like any good story, thereâs highs and lows. There's characters who you will be rooting for, characters you will hate, and quite a few that you will feel conflicted about. Aside from the excellent music, solid artwork, and engaging cast, I think this gameâs main strength is its ability to make the playersfeelthings, both good and bad. It is, in all aspects, a bittersweet story.So, after all this, you still want to play Fata Morgana? Congrats, I think youâre part of the crowd that will really enjoy this game. Besides Steam, this game is also available on PS4, Switch, and Vita (lol). The PS4 and Switch releases are enhanced ports, with the subtitle 'Dreams of the Revenants Edition'. There are a few small differences between the Steam version of the game and the console ports. Mainly, there are more detailed backgrounds in the Switch and PS4 ports. Due to budget constraints, many of the backgrounds within the initial game (including the Steam version) are vague and blurry. The enhanced port contains nicer background art that more accurately reflects the quality of the game's sprites and illustrations.Fata Morgana also has a prequel and a side game, which are included in the PS4 and Switch bundles. The prequel must be purchased separately on Steam. The side game is currently not available at all on Steam, and due to licensing issues, the developers have confirmed that it may never be added. However, there is a silent playthrough on youtube, so that's always an option if you own the first two games on Steam and don't want to buy the collection on console. I would recommend NOT looking up ANYTHING relating to the prequel or side game until you have finished the first game, as it is quite easy to accidentally spoil yourself. There are also a few bonus side stories included with both the Steam and console versions of this game, but again, these should not be viewed until you complete the main story.So, I guess Iâll end this with a TLDR. Is this game good? Absolutely. This is one of my favorite stories of all time, and I love it dearly. Should you play it? It depends. If you read this whole review and youâre still on board, then I think you should definitely give it a shot. If you got bored and skipped to the bottom of my review or have some doubts after reading the points I raised, it may not be the sort of thing you would enjoy.",positive

The House in Fata Morgana,"9/10More than a game, The House in Fata Morgana is a finely crafted work of art. The unique and clever Gothic art style, together with the magnificent and shocking story and moving music, is bound to bring players a unique gaming experience.The plot of the game is about a grand romantic tragedy that spans from the Middle Ages to the Industrial Age, combining some magical elements but still not losing its standard. With the game's suspenseful atmosphere and the plot of the process of gradually approaching the truth of the experience, players who can immerse themselves in it will be able to appreciate the charm of its script. At the same time, The House in Fata Morgana in the visual novel is also unique in the subject matter, this is not to be missed by interested players.The game does not have a full voice is a big regret, to a certain extent, although it can bring players infinite space for reverie, also brings the loss of immersion. The plot is relatively slow, whether you can survive the slow burn for some players is also a major problem. At the same time, the antiquated system interface and feedback are also major flaws, the gothic art style for players who do not like this style is also a major threshold.There is no doubt that The House in Fata Morgana is very good, it is different from the many Japanese visual novels on the market, and the quality of the plot itself is also excellent, and will not let the players who came to the name disappointed. But as the saying goes, it's hard to adjust to its shortcomings or if you're not a fan of the game's theme, you don't have to spend time trying.",positive
The House in Fata Morgana,"""We cry at tragedies because we draw parallels with our own lives""The House in Fata Morgana is not for the faint of heart. The stories you will be told are tragic, and I mean really tragic. In short, the game starts off with a maid guiding you through a cursed mansion where she reveals tragedies that have taken place from different eras. Each door she guides you through tells a a completely different tale and each tale gets more deeper and darker than the last. I tend to like darker/more mature stories but even I was caught off guard after witnessing what was behind a certain door. You actually hope the characters can overcome their misfortune because they aren't so bland and one-dimensional. The art is gorgeous and the hauntingly beautiful soundtrack is so fitting. The story doesn't just throw a bunch of tragedies at your face and calls it a day, no, everything is so well thought out. It's not always gloomy and depressing, the games main objective is not to make the player feel sad (it may seem that way at glance) but by making you see the tragedies from different perspectives you can then piece it together and get the bigger picture which is far more rewarding than simply being given the answer. If I were to describe The House in Fata Morgana in two words, it would be: Tragically Beautiful.While you're witnessing what's behind each door just remember, ""You were able to bear them because they weren't your tragedies.""",positive
The House in Fata Morgana,"I'm not one for reviews, I think this is the first time I have ever left a review on steam for anything, despite being familiar with the site for a decade.

I'm not going to go into story details, nor am I going to analyze any themes in this comment, I simply want to say that this is the single best story I have ever experienced.I have read all kinds of manga and books, shows, movies, even other visual novels, but nothing has ever conveyed such human beauty so perfectly, so masterfully, as The House in Fata Morgana. I am not joking when I say that if the human race were to go extinct, and a civilization far into the future were to dig up our remains to better understand humans, amidst the traces of our ugly history, our cruelty, and our inexcusable evil, they somehow come across The House in Fata Morgana, because no piece of media I'm aware of has ever captured the complexity of humanity so, so well, from the ugly, to the beautiful, from the painful, to the hopeful, and our hatred contrasted with our ability to love.There is your life before this novel, and there's your life after this novel.

So how does the House in Fata Morgana do? Excellent. While a bit older (initially released in 2012), the story of this VN is undeniably great. For those more familiar with the genre, it's immediately apparent that this VN is very different from the typical, choose a girl you're interested in. Now I'm not saying that's neither a good thing nor a bad thing, just bringing to light the notion of it being different and frankly a breath of fresh air for me personally. With that bit out of the way, the story of Fata Morgana is truly an interesting tale. To the point that I was caught off guard or surprised (in more than one way), more than a few times. Without giving too much, I can only tell you that the mix of the supernatural and the viewing of different time periods to make for a very unique dynamic to unraveling the complex story that Fata Morgana has to tell. On your journey you will meet a great many curiosities that will have you wondering in most cases. For people who like a good read, this is a great one.+Music:The music truly sets the atmosphere of this grim tale, however not just in its darker moments, but even the more lighthearted ones. As stated earlier, you travel through many eras, and depending on the circumstances of the time you are witnessing the music follows suit to an almost extraordinary degree. My particular favorite sound track is the one during the era of the ""third door"". Afraid I won't be giving you any implications as to what it is, you'll have to find out for yourself ;)+Visuals:Just as the story and music of this VN takes a very different tone in what it does compared to most others in its genre, the art is no different in that regard. Many VNs go for the more cute aesthetic, but in Fata Morgana it goes with water colors for backgrounds (an interesting choice) and uses character designs mostly of those in the European region (when typically most anime scenarios take place and use characters based in Japan). The design choices presented by Fata Morgana truly provides a unique experience when in contrast with others sharing the same method of storytelling.The Bad-Age:The most notable ""flaw"" that's of immediate notice is the age of the game. While released on steam in 2016, the game is originally from 2012. As a result the aspect ratio isn't meant for more modern day screens, causing you to play with black bars on the side. This isn't the biggest of deals, but is worth mentioning as it is the single visible flaw that is prevalent throughout the entire game.-Cliches:The story is very well done, to the point I was led astray at many points, often finding out once a huge twist was involved. However, I was able to guess a few things story-wise while playing that the VN treats as more important plot points. Of course, this is me grasping at straws, really I was mostly curious throughout the whole thing, in some cases I may have guessed right on the occurrences that would take place, but it usually wasn't with 100% certainty. I've even had my own theories shoved in my face with my mouth just wide open due to the turn of events that actually occurred.-Choices:The game doesn't possess too many options for causing the story to diverge. And often times, the choice to progress, or head towards a bad ending, is fairly obvious. For those who really enjoy the multiple paths a story can take, then perhaps it should be advised to reconsider the purchase. I personally didn't feel too troubled with this fact, as I was far more interested in seeing where everything was gonna go.ConclusionPros:+An incredible tale everyone should consider+Possesses a soundtrack fitting for every era and situation you find yourself in+Unique choice of art style that really helps it stand outCons:-A bit dated all things considered-Predictable in some instances-Few and obvious choices for branching pathsFinal Score:8.5/10While I may have made a few points on what could be considered bad for this VN, I in no way think that those points were enough to take away from my experience with the story Fata Morgana had to offer. I will admittedly say that the beginning felt quite slow (and I usually get into it pretty fast) and even felt like a grind. However, after a certain point (I'd have to say once you reach the second door) the ball really gets rolling. It lacks a true HD experience, and is lacking in choices (the main point that could be considered gameplay in something that would otherwise just be a book). If these are things that are essential to your experience as a reader, than this may not be the VN for you, but if you can look past those faults and want a truly nice, unique story in an otherwise overpopulated genre, then I highly suggest picking this up.",positive

The House in Fata Morgana,"This is a game, a story, about love.It's also about time, tragedy, about hope, hate, despair and everything that falls in between. It revolves around a cursed mansion and its inhabitants in different time periods and explores and questions themes like identity, trust, desire, violence, society, redemption, reincarnation,reconstruction; a mind bending reexamination of lives lived.It's about the big things in life but it's also about the little things. The things that constantly shapes us when we're not really looking, that gives our day-to-day its meaning and substance.But more than anything, it's about the complexities of love. Love as a motivator, a discomfort, a longing, a heartache, a blessing, a curse, but most of all, as a relationship: the uneasy steps out of individual comfort zones and the creation of something new together. Love as a path to growth.It's almost perplexing how they manage to make it all work, it's structurally among the most ambitious tales I've ever witnessed in video games, but they do, it does work, the missteps are few, the memories of it all absolutely enchanting.It wouldn't have worked without the astonishing soundtrack. It handles everything with surprising ease, frames every scene with emotion and wonder.It wouldn't have worked without the art, the beautiful depictions of scenery and life, the characters and their subtle expressions.It wouldn't have worked without the interaction, the implications of the choices feels real.It wouldn't have worked without the prose, but it wouldn't have worked asjustprose.Which is why it's a video game.And it's the greatest love story on Steam.",positive

The House in Fata Morgana,"Definition of tragedy according to Merriam-Webster:""a serious drama typically describing a conflict between the protagonist and a superior force (such as destiny) and having a sorrowful or disastrous conclusion that elicits pity or terror""To that I would like to add:""see: The House in Fata Morgana""The House in Fata Morgana is not a particularly nice game. If it can be called a ""game"" in the first place. Visual novels often face scrutiny from gamers of not being (proper) games due to their lack or complete absence of gameplay. Games like Danganronpa, The Zero Escape trilogy, or 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim get around this by adding certain gameplay elements to break the monotony of reading. Even 428: Shibuya Scramble constantly presents the player with decisions to make which either result in a premature bad ending, or if chosen correctly, with the advancement of the story. In this sense it has a sort of puzzle mechanic that actively engages the player.The House in Fata Morgana largely has nothing of that and takes its genre name literally: It's a novel told with the help of (audio)visuals. There are no class trials, no mini games and no walking around in the environment. All you do is read. This is what you sign up for: A visual novel in the truest sense of the word.""What"" you read, therefore, is of vital importance as to keep you engaged for its approximately 30 hour playtime (readtime?) depending on how fast you read. I wasn't being overly dramatic in the beginning when I implied that The House in Fata Morgana is the definition of tragedy. Every story, every character, and every single development is rooted in tragedy, immense suffering and sorrow, that sometimes gets resolved, but more often than not results in a suffocating darkness that is thicker and more harrowing than the one that came before. It is different from the visual novel Doki Doki Literature Club in the sense that it's less about the immediate shock and complete twist of its story. It's like the difference between a horror movie that relies on jump scares and one that slowly, quietly, and imperceptibly gets under your skin. The House in Fata Morgana is the latter.As you can imagine it is a rather difficult task to talk about the story â the only important element of the game â without going into the territory of Spoilerville. The gothic horror story revolves around a cursed house where multiple tragedies take place. These are told in several short stories which all culminate in an overall bigger story. Is this too vague of a description or is it everything you need to know? Maybe instead of describing the actual story or stories of The House in Fata Morgana, I can touch on the overall atmosphere and themes.For example, it reminded me a great deal of Mary Shelley's ""Frankenstein"". Not because of monsters or anything literal, but because of the feeling of despair and hopelessness, and the tragic incidences born out of misunderstandings. Such naive things as humour, optimisim, and hope are rarely seen, and if they are then only to throw you back down again. After all, if you forget what hope is how can you be reminded of how much despair you can endure? The game wants to put you through the wringer again and again.So, why? Why would you want to play such game? Why would anyone want to read such a story to begin with? As you can imagine, I'm not able to speak for everyone, but I assume that every reader/player sees the silver lining in the story telling. The reason why we keep on reading is because the main characters in the game keep on going. As is with many stories, we want the characters to succeed in whatever manner this may take form, so it doesn't matter much whether the hopelessness lasts for only a short time or for the majority of the experience. It's like what Samwise Gamgee said in his iconic speech in Osgiliath.""[...] how could the end be happy. How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad happened. But in the end, itâs only a passing thing, this shadow. Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer.""The darkness in ""The House in Fata Morgana"" may be as oppressive and heartwrenching as few stories of the recent past have exuded, but even that will have to pass. At least, that is the fools hope that we desperately cling to. Will The House in Fata Morgana reward this hope or will it end like a Korean thriller that dashes your hope of a happy ending? That, you will have to find out on your own.Personally, I had a few weeks to let the story sink in. Maybe I will then have more appreciation for the story, because I had a heart time being invested in the characters' stories and arcs. In all frankness, I was bored quite often. I was constantly hoping that at some point I would develop even the slightest bit of attachment to one of the characters. In the end, however, this never happened. I never much cared for any of them, and if your entire game experience is built on character and story, then you are in trouble. It's unlike other video game genres where weak elements can be balanced out by its other strengths. The House in Fata Morgana can't do that, as it puts all of its eggs into its story basket. And to me, this basket is not that enticing.Would I still recommend The House in Fata Morgana? That depends, doesn't it? After all, we are talking about one of the highest rated and most dearly beloved visual novels of the last few years, aren't we? So, there must be something to it, right? There sure is. Fata Morgana is beautifully written and constructed masterfully. It is clear even to me, that the studio at Novectacle took their time to not only tell a wholly original story, but also one that is so deftly constructed that it achieved the herculean task of making something complex appear so effortless. In that sense, I appreciate the construction of the story more than the story itself. That is what I will remember this game most fondly for. That and the hauntingly mesmerizing soundtrack. It's not the music itself that is so enchanting, but the choir and chants that give the soundtrack an otherworldy aspect. There is also a jazz song, that I really enjoyed. For one, because it is just really good, the other, because it sounds ""normal"" compared to the rest of the soundtrack. And in a melancholic, tragic, Dante-esque nighmarish fairy tale, you at times want to grasp at all the normalcy you can get.This concludes my review of The House in Fata Morgana and also my story with it. As highly praised as it is, it wasn't really for me. I didn't shed a tear, my engagement with the characters was almost non-existent, and the few parts that I did enjoy weren't enough to add my stirring endorsement to the vast ocean of other endorsements. If, however, my barebones description of the story and my trying attempt at conveying the emotional appeal of it, suits your preferences just fine, and you'd rather believe in all the critical acclaim than in the opinion of this schmuck, then go right ahead - walk into the mansion. Do be warned though. Dante's entrance to hell had a famous inscription that also applies here: Abandon all hope, ye who enter.",positive
The House in Fata Morgana,"Product received for freetl;drhave your life ruined by fictional characters once more.I've had my fair share of visual novels throughout the years and with this knowledge I can openly say that this is hands down the best visual novel localized in English in 2016 and my favourite one ever.At first I had never, ever once heard ofFata Morganabefore I read about its announcement and now I feel its story is one of the most memorable I've ever read. It can't be easily forgotten. It's been three months since I finished it and I already find myself wanting to read through it again because my feelings about this story have not changed and are still the same I was having after immediately finishing it.First of all, I'd like to start saying that readers must be warned thatThe House in Fata Morgana's story is pretty heavy on the dark side. If you're okay with having your heart being wrenched apart from your body and someone stomping on it while laughing at your misery, then having this happening several times more, you'll have no problem fitting in around here.If you're a visual novel fan like me, you must be accustomed to the usual anime (and sometimes moeish) art style that vns have. Please do not step down from this one cause of the unusual and more western art style of what you're used to, because that's almost what I did, and at the end the art ended up being one of the things I appreciated a lot.If you're not yet a fan of this media format called visual novel or could never get into one, you're probably here reading the reviews because you've been allured by the art style and heavy colours. Yes, throughout the game there always is some eerie atmosphere and tragedies are what these characters eat for breakfast. I recommend trying out the demo (not on Steam) which includes the first two full chapters that last several hours.I must dedicate a paragraph to the music, the star of this title. Know that this game is non-voiced and there's a good reason for this choice. The OST consists of 65 tracks, probably almost half of which arevocal tracksand sung in Portuguese. I really feel I must stress on the importance of it, because you typically cannot find sung tracks in a visual novel (apart from opening and ending songs) and yet here you are given the delight of enjoying amazing music from beginning to end. It truly feels like an unique experience.",positive
The House in Fata Morgana,"Excellent story about love, tragedy, revenge, and salvation, that is backed up by a phenominal sound track. The House in Fata Morgana is not just one of the best VNs I have read, but one of the best stories in general I have come across.What starts with a maid telling you the tales and history of a mansion you awoke in, turns into a story involving people's lives over the span of centuries, how they are all connected to each other, and how all their fates are linked back to a single curse upon the mansion and the people within it.To top it off, the gothic horror art style (much like the music) is very fitting, and a breath of fresh air from the moe-blobs we currently see in every VN being released.",positive
The House in Fata Morgana,"Product refundedIf you don't mind playing an inferior version of a fantastic visual novel with less content, then disregard this review and refer to the many other deservedly positive reviews. I would highly recommend getting the Dreams of the Revenants version on Switch, PS4 or Vita.The VN itself is marvellous, it's literally the best I've ever read. But I cannot in good conscience recommend an edition of the game that is so inferior to another one that is readily available.I'd only completed Chapter One on this version and was completely captivated with the story. So much that I went to see if its developer, Novectacle, had a website or catalogue of other games. I found their Twitter which stated that there's a much better version on Switch, PS4 and Vita called the Dreams of the Revenants.The Dreams of the Revenants version has:- Much better, crisper, redone, HD visuals in widescreen- Much better music quality which does the amazing soundtrack justice- The base game and its prequel which are available on Steam- A lot of side stories to provide more background- A new voiced episode Reincarnation- The option to rewind in-game which is very convenientWhat's more is, Novectacle have stated that there's no (current) plans to port the Dreams of the Revenants version to PC, due to licensing or ownership issues. They may update the base game and prequel with the better visuals and sound from the DOTR version, but the extra content will remain exclusive for at the very least, a while.I do not blame Novectacle; they are a very small company. However, I loathe having an inferior version of a game so I immediately applied for a refund on Steam and purchased DOTR on Switch instead and have no regrets.It does also irritate me that the PC version supplied the money for a better version that won't appear on its original platform which facilitated its existence in the first place... but I digress. This happens often with Japanese games and I should've done my research better.I've edited this review recently because I still get comments on it five years later (mostly unhinged) to address that it's since been added to Switch digitally in PAL regions, so just get it on the eShop and enjoy an amazing experience.Also apparently there's a mod that brings DOTR stuff to the PC version on the Fata Morgana Discord. I don't use Discord as I don't have an affinity for grooming children and I don't think the average consumer should have to mod a game to access content that is available on every other platform.",negative
The House in Fata Morgana,"While my steam profile may show around ~20 hrs as my total playtime, let me make a small disclaimer and say that I had originally bought this game years ago and only finished it for the first time with the release of the Dreams of the Revenants Edition on PS4. When I had originally started the game, I grew disinterested about halfway through the first chapter and quit. That was quite possibly one of the worst decisions I had ever made. I was a buffoon, an absolute imbecile, a complete dunce, to ever put it off as long as I did.To start off, the artstyle of the game is one that will immediately drive you away or pique your interest. The character designs are some of the most distinctly non-anime artwork I've seen done for a VN, and it is drenched in gothic-horror aesthetic. Personally, I'm on the side of people who that it's absolutely stunning. The PS4 version features updated artwork that replace some of the originals used in this version. While that may disappoint some, I would argue that it's hardly an issue.Before getting into the narrative, I would like to note that the soundtrack to this game is some of the best music I've ever heard in my life. The artistic choice to have a lot of the songs written and sung in Portuguese is oddly one of the best things about the game. It also has zero voice acting, so the atmosphere of the game is audibly enhanced by the soundtrack. In fact, I would argue that in an objectively worse timeline, Fata Morgana would have voice acting to cover up the beautiful music. To any fan of just genuinely good music, I would definitely recommend listening to the OST.It's quite hard to explain what makes Fata Morgana so good without dispelling much of the narrative. Just note that Fata Morgana's story is one that is built upon layers and layers. The story is structured throughout your tour of the mansion's history, covering roughly a century's time. In the beginning of the game you'll be observing separate tragedies that befell the previous masters of the mansion. Some of these stories are so tight and concise that many can hold up on their own, each having a distinct theme from one another. So much so that you'll hardly notice the grand narrative building up to the game's climax. Broad in scope, these characters and conflicts are all interwoven and connected, and while you play you'll begin noticing patterns that are occurring , which leaves you to speculate and become even more curious at the mystery that surrounds it all. I will acknowledge that the beginning of the game is a patience test, but I promise that the buildup is worth it.------------------------Here is a brief summary of the first half of the game:You awaken in the dark mansion, approached by a maid who refers to you as the master of the estate. The mansion is one that evokes a sense of nonexistence, enraptured in thick fog. Despite her claims about waiting for your arrival for years, her presence is eerie and voice is lifeless. You feel as though you're in a cognitive daze, confused on what you're doing at the mansion and who you even are. The maid offers you to take a tour across the mansion, hoping that it refresh your memory. You take her hand and follow her through the mansion, holding on tightly, as letting go would leave you to be washed away in the waves of history.From here, you go through three doors, each that exhibit a specific era of the mansions history where you follow each master of their time. After witnessing the tragic tales of the first three doors, you finally arrive at a fourth door. However, this door is one that holds your own story. Throughout the game up to this point, you have witnessed three distinct tragedies that befell the previous masters of the mansion. Now, standing before your own misfortune, can you bear witness to your own fate?After completing this chapter, the game takes a turn in terms of pacing and layout. For the sake of brevity and spoilers sake, I will not discuss the rest of the game.------------------------Despite being based in a fictional world, Fata Morgana hardly ever relies on its supernatural elements to tell its story. It essentially ignores every anime trope that it could have done and instead arranges a beautiful tapestry of, at its core, humanity. Rather than lecturing you on some grand philosophical message, I encourage you to enjoy Fata Morgana as you would a dramatic play. That is, this story will leave you crying, taking you on a roller-coaster of emotions, and leaving you drained by the end of it.It has an undeniable dignity and sophistication with the subject matter it covers. Without going into it too much, I would say that Fata Morgana is best when it makes you empathize and understand the driving motivations behind it's cast of characters. While many suffer from an ""Achilles Heel"", the character's in this game are not something that can be easily summarized. The character's perspectives, their conflicts, and the flaws that plague them are in full display in the spiderweb that is Fata Morgana.There are many instances where you could traditionally think of the story as ""done"". However, Fata Morgana's true talent is just how many times it will subvert your expectations, have a literal ""but wait, there's more!"" moment, and continue to pull the rug under you. By the end, the story had left me absolutely breathless.For everything that could be said about Fata Morgana, I will leave you with this:This game is one that has made me bear witness to some of the finest, articulate, and engaging characters that I have ever seen written. At first glance, Fata Morgana is elegant in its dreariness, but this is a rabbit hole which often leads to unexpected conclusions that evoke a softer side from you. From the internal struggles that we hide from others, to the often awkward, charming ways that we fall in love; Fata Morgana will leave you in a weeping mess by the end of it.As of me writing this, Steam statistics show that not even 60% of players get past Chapter 1. I myself am guilty of this, so I don't particularly blame them for quitting. However, I intend to make it a point to please please please beg of you to stick with this game until the end. It's already a miracle that you somehow discovered it's mere existence on steam, so I sincerely ask you to take the chance if you're even slightly interested in it.Extra:- For the sake of spoilers, I sincerely ask that you don't look up ANYTHING on the game until after you finish it. That is, this game is pretty much unknown to the general public and its hard to find pretty much anything about it when you google it, but still.- There is an amazing Achievement + Log Guide on the community board on Steam, its spoiler free and I would deem almost necessary as Fata Moru has some instances where you need to choose a correct dialogue choice. Not doing so will result in a bad ending, some of which spoil the true ending.- The Dreams of the Revenants Edition is only on PS4/VIta (Switch soon). It comes with the House in Fata Morgana, a prequel, and a sequel.-  The prequel is titled ""A Requiem for Innocence"". However, it's necessary to play Fata Morgana first to understand the story's context.-The sequel is essentially just 10 hours of Fanservice that's exclusive to PS4. Watch it on Youtube after finishing Fata Morgana and Requiem.",positive

The House in Fata Morgana,"This is perhaps one of the best stories I've ever read.I don't know how to describe the beautiful yet raw feelings that I received while reading this VN without spoiling everything. I won't actually spoil a thing, but please believe me when I say that the price of the game is well-worth the content.  Most everyone has said why better than I could, but my personal experience is that this is a game that has a way that forces you to get in touch with your heart in ways you weren't expecting. It takes certain tropes and spins them around. It makes you think in different ways. It is painful.  It tells you there isn't always one answer.Some things can't change, but also, some things CAN.It's a game that genuinely understands the human emotions, and if you can think you can handle it, please try it out.Which by the way, the content warnings exist because there are some really dark and traumatic scenes in the game! I actually commend the company for providing proper content warnings because this does have a lot of distressing content! Some of the content even contains spoilers (which they do warn for), but they're not afraid to lay it all out to make sure fans know what they're getting into. That care that they have for the audience without needing a push for it is great.And also, from what I've seen, I think they handled this content with care while also not romanticizing any of it which I GREATLY appreciate. It's painful, but it drives the point of the game home. I can only comment on part of the game because I don't have personal experience with all of this content myself, perhaps those with similar experiences will disagree? But so far from what I have seen, everyone seems to agree that with such sensitive subject matter, it really was done tastefully.The artwork by Moyataro is also beautiful and fitting for the story (I REALLY love the faces especially holy cow), and the music is simple but beautiful and if some of the songs don't get stuck in your head then you're stronger than I am, lol. I don't normally buy game soundtracks cuz I don't listen to instrumental but I plan to buy this one asap. Also this VN is LONG. ITS 30 HOURS LONG. It might not be a ""game"" but it's LITERALLY 30 HOURS OF TEXT and that's me being a really fast reader okay. I'm telling you, it's worth the money!This game is just done with so much care and especially LOVE. The original company and the translation team both have put so much effort! You can feel it! I could write three essays on this game in like two days if I wanted to. I wish I could talk about my favorite parts of the game and truly explain the beauty of what this company created. But I want you all to enjoy the game for yourself, and have your own journey to form your own thoughts and opinions along the way.BUY THIS GAME. DO IT.",positive
The House in Fata Morgana,"I feel almost intimidated writing a review for this game, because it is - in my opinion - the best visual novel in existence, and my word stacking could hardly do it justice. Thatâs why Iâm just going to write a simple summary first, before I make my attempt:Pros:Complex and fulfilling story that draws out real emotions in the playerRealistic character developmentMany, many plot-twists that tie in together perfectlyBeautiful art and mood-appropriate surroundingsMost likely the best soundtrack I have ever come acrossLeaves an impact and a lot of thought in the readerStruggles and dilemmas that are not presented cheaply, nor unrealisticallyAuto-saving during choices and a lot of save spaces that can be locked so that you cannot overwrite them by accidentExtrasCons:No âskip only readâ option, although in this game thatâs not really a problemNow, letâs start at the beginning. When I first opened this game, the first thing I noticed was how the art and the original soundtrack worked perfectly to create an almost palpable atmosphere. That, together with the writing style, has set a mood so intense I could literallyfeelall the emotions the characters were going through.There was one thing I was disappointed with at first - the backgrounds. At the beginning of the game, it just didnât seem to fit to me - everything had so much effort put into it, and so the background art looked simple and out of place in contrast. It even birthed a faint feeling of doubt in me. But as I delved deeper into the mansion and its story, somehow all of that transformed - the backgrounds were still done the same way, but I didnât mind anymore, I actually loved it. Thatâs when I realized the choice to use those backgrounds was definitely the right one. They were perfect - didnât show too much, just enough to hint on something deep within you and let your mind paint the picture.Visual novel is a perfect fit for this story. I have read a lot of books that could be turned into visual novels, and a lot visual novels that could be turned into books. This one is unique - it works with everything it has, and uses every aspect of storytelling and each piece of what makes visual novels a genre, and ties them together. Words, pictures, sounds, emotions and assumptions all work in tandem to create an experience unlike any other, and really suck you into the lives and fates of the gameâs characters.Speaking of characters, I was surprised at how well they have been handled. Each and every one of them feels like a real person - one that you cannot just love or hate, but one that you can have conflicting feelings about or even change your mind about completely without forgetting their previous transgressions.Without spoiling anything, I also have to praise the developer on how they handled gender and identity issues. It can be very tricky to tackle these things, especially in certain time-periods and settings, but they didnât seem to struggle at all. I believe that players who have ever experienced gender dysphoria - or really any kind of dysphoria about their body - will really appreciate that.I cannot but recommend this game to everyone. If you dislike reading, this game might be a bit too tedious for you, but if you enjoy books and/or visual novels, do not hesitate. I promise you that it will be a very rewarding experience.",positive

The House in Fata Morgana,"(originally posted on my backloggd)the house in fata morgana surprised me by being truly as beautiful and powerful as i've heard many say. the art feels like something from a storybook (so many facial expressions on its delicately drawn sprites!), its music will stay with me for the rest of my life, and the care poured into its characters and intricate story completely won my heart. *so* lovely. as others have said, it is definitely a visual novel that's best experienced without knowing too much of what's ahead. still, you should know some of what you're getting into.the basic premise is that you awaken in a dark mansion with a maid kneeling at your feet. she somehow knows you, although you don't know who you are. so, to help you regain yourself, she walks you through a series of memories that take place within the house.the house in fata morgana is a genuinely brutal tragedy. it has themes of grief, relationships, martyrdom, misogyny, patriarchy, power, isolation, religion, ideas of normalcy, forgiveness, and obsession. there are men being awful. you will see characters in their lowest places, struggling with mental health and who they are. even when it's a little on the nose or theatrical, fata morgana handles these themes with impressive grace. this visual novel is easily a favourite of mine.for content warnings, there is also torture, murder, gore, sexual assault (mainly off screen, but still intense), and abuse. there are more warnings you can look up, at the risk of spoilers! as well, the authors note that not all the language they use they agree with, but that occasionally makes it hard to tell what words are used intentionally or not. (so, a reminder that words like 'w**re' and 'savage' aren't to be used as insults, and to call sex workers what they are - sex workers, etc.) later in the story, i was also surprised by someone leaning hard into bioessentialism. but! i'm glad i kept reading. many characters in fata morgana deserve a chance to grow. considering their circumstances, they often have so much working against them.it was the story's tenderness that caught me off guard moreso than the brutality, however. what a relentless, heartbreaking examination of seeking a better everyday life! the story as a whole just has so much love, patience, and respect for its characters and the trauma they carry. one scene depicts someone experiencing gentle touch at the hands of a lover after knowing only violence - i had to take a break afterward. i will never forget the beauty of that scene.in terms of accessibility, fata morgana includes extremely photosensitive characters while unfortunately ignoring any readers who might be similar. there are a few white screens and many intense rapid flashes of white as the story unfolds. some can be predicted, but definitely not all of them! they were effective, i guess? they didn't make me feel good.but. otherwise. some things quite close to my heart fata morgana has spun into words and set to one of the most stunning soundtracks i've ever heard. its characters truly seem to breathe, grounded by the music and brought to life by lovely prose and detailed art - with its cheesier moments being easy to forgive. and, while the story may not get everything right, it's powerful to find characters so well written that you see parts of yourself reflected back to you even if you took your own path and live a different identity. the moments i couldn't strongly relate to also had such emotional weight that i could still appreciate everything very much. the story felt quite long, but it is all so expertly woven together that in the end i didn't mind.so, if you're okay with its themes, i'd recommend the house in fata morgana again and again and again. it's worth the time for something this beautiful! i would adore if, perhaps, we both fell in love with this flawed masterpiece.",positive
The House in Fata Morgana,"The House in Fata Morganais such an awesome game that it's impossible for me to find the right words to describe that tremendous effect it caused on me. I love this novel immensely! If there're still any players who haven't heard about it or haven't played it... Don't hesitate! It's an absolute must!Storywise it's the best visual novel I've ever read! So many unexpected, astonishing, mind-blowing twists, the plot really is stunning. The whole experience was so emotional for me that I had to drop the game several times. But I just couldn't do it completely, as my thoughts kept coming back, despite all tragic moments I wanted to know the truth. It's a full-length visual novel. So even if you're a fast reader and don't take everything close to heart, it will take some time, and for me personally it's a great feature. Long stories do help with a deeper immersion. I genuinely envy anyone who is going to dive into this amazing story for the first time. The game really resonated with my soul.oh my, the best story I've ever playedA Screenshot of The House in Fata MorganaBy:ÐÐ¸Ð·Ð°Ð½ÑÑÐ¾Ð¿When I started playing it I couldn't even imagine it'd be that tragic, that heartbreaking... It was so intense! But at the same time it's an extremely romantic story, the best I've ever read. I even recollected the joke that such love stories are dangerous 'cause unfortunately these pure feelings are next to impossible to encounter in real life, so such examples may set the expectations unreachably high. But well, sometimes it's nice to dream, to admire perfect, though fantastic examples. So it was not only tears, there were many funny moments that made me smile. Really a complex story.What's more it is not just about love. It touches so many complicated topics. A really thought-provoking experience. Revenge, forgiveness (I've typed this word and my heart sank... Michel, you are an angel, indeed. I wouldn't be able to... aahhh), insanity, dark themes of human nature, but also redemption, salvation, and, of course, true love amidst the terrible tragedies.What an unexpected ending. I sincerely thought it'd be smth tragic as the whole game. Catharsis!A Screenshot of The House in Fata MorganaBy:ÐÐ¸Ð·Ð°Ð½ÑÑÐ¾Ð¿I believe this game deserves the tag 'Great Soundtrack' most. I usually make the sound as quite as possible not to be distracted from reading but in this game soundtrack is essential for the full experience, for that unique ambiance. Though I must admit singing was not to my liking at first, it WAS distracting but I got used to it soon.Art is gorgeous! The protagonist's sprite is the prettiest I've ever seen. I know tastes differ but for me Michel is divinely handsome. As I've mentioned it took me months to finish the game but quite soon I became almost addicted, reading at least some minutes a day to get the opportunity to lay my eyes on his beauty, to enjoy his appealing personality. Michel as a daily fix...breathtaking <3A Screenshot of The House in Fata MorganaBy:ÐÐ¸Ð·Ð°Ð½ÑÑÐ¾Ð¿There's just one little thing that slightly stained my fanatic admiration. That last achievement is annoying! As a completionist I couldn't leave it but after such a catharsis to begin the game for the second time was a bit sacrilegious. I definitely will play through it again but when all emotions and thoughts calm down, not immediately, absolutely not. So it took me lots of time to skip through the game. Well, at least I managed to write a review while doing it but I can't say I found it enjoyable.All in all, it was an impressive, overwhelming experience. I'm grateful for all those powerful emotions! This visual novel is undoubtedly a masterpiece. Make yourself a gift and play it. Highly recommended!Find more in aReading Nook",positive
The House in Fata Morgana,"The House in Fata Morgana tries to be different than traditional anime styled VNs, and it not only succeeds in doing this.. it's in a completely different league of it's own. By the time I finished it, I felt as though the game had embedded itself into my soul. I couldn't help but empathize with all of the characters, I really felt for them. Every character is loaded with depth and has multiple sides to them. The story is exceptionally well written, with many shocking plot twists that you likely won't see coming.The soundtrack is hauntingly captivating, fitting the scenes depicted perfectly and increases the emotional impact of everything exponentially. It's not only one of my favorite soundtracks for a VN, but any genre period. Seriously, it's worth buying The House in Fata Morgana for the soundtrack alone, it's that good. Sprites are gorgeous, and prove that a VN doesn't need traditional anime styled art to be appealing.. the sprites are actually better looking than any other VN I've played. The artwork in combination with the soundtrack sets off a very unique incredibly dark atmosphere that you would be hard pressed to find in any other game, especially horror themed.If I had to list any flaws, it'd be that there's no widescreen support or voice acting. I couldn't be anymore pleased, the experience was amazing and it's hard to put into words. It's more something that you need to experience for yourself than take reviews at face value. IMO this is the best visual novel you can buy at $25 full price on steam. Well worth the price, and will last you for 20 hours minimum.",positive
The House in Fata Morgana,Amazing visual novel. The first 3 chapters start out kinda slow but by the time you are done with chapter 4 everything starts picking up and making sense. The story is amazing once it picks up and the visuals are great. My biggest love for this game is the o.s.t 100% 10/10 music.,positive
The House in Fata Morgana,"As cliche as it sounds, this VN changed my life. Like, literally. I would never spoil the ending in a million years but... Let's just say that I can forgive and sympathize with just a little more ease than before. It's one of the best literary experiences I've ever had, but with things that books don't have, like lush Gothic illustrations and amazingly composed music. The House in Fata Morgana makes the most of its medium to deliver a powerful, well-written story about human greed, sorrow, savagery, and our power to forgive.",positive
The House in Fata Morgana,"Melodramatic KInoThe House in Fata Morganais one of the few visual novels I urge everyone even remotely interested in to purchase, install and start reading right away. Simply put, it's a fantastic romance that deserves (mostly) all the praise it gets. The twists repeatedly get you by surprise until the very end, and the narrative progression is so cleverly put that you can't help but commend the writers for it. To add to that, the main trio isabsurdlywell-developed, and has outright some of the most interesting and creative interactions and character progressions I've ever seen in any form of medium. This paragraph alone would make THiFM a worthwhile title, but there's more.Stellar storytelling apart, Fata Morgana packs a mesmerizing, out-of-this-world soundtrack. If you're keen on Visual Novels, or are at least familiar with their concept, then you already know how much of a key difference competent art direction makes in the end product. And if I could choose any title in particular from the genre to exhibit that, it would without a doubt be this one. I am almost ashamed to say I bought it afterwards (as it's rare for me to do so), but it doesn't feel like I even had a conscient choice in the matter: the scores are just that consistent and mind-blowing. Great music, great tones, great setup for the atmosphere in different parts of the story, great everything. It may sound overkill to dedicate an entire block of text to this portion of the novel in particular, butit really does play a major role in establishing the tone and quality of the game.The backgrounds and portraits are another point of interest as well, although some would say to a lesser extent than the other two major ones. And to be honest, I'd have to somewhat agree. While the portraits present in Fata are undoubtedly great, theyreallyshow their scarceness a couple times. And it's noticeable, too. The backgrounds are more abundant (and characteristic). This is the only ""major"" criticism I could give THiFM,apart from the ""questionable"" pacing in some parts of the story. The novel does takes a while to truly ""take off"". However, this is really more of a ""ambiguous"" pro/con altogether, since while the setup has clear intentions and isextremelywell utilized in the overarching plot afterwards, the moderate tonal shift of the novel is definitely there, and I can see many readers having mixed feelings with it. It is my opinion that the novel could easily have achieved a""10/10 GOAT""status if it stuckjust a little bit morewith some of the""realistic"", historical dialogue, and put some more portraits. I don't believe that was the plan for the novel, however, and what we have herestillis anamazingwestern-inspired japanese Visual Novel that absolutelyexcelsat manga-signature melodrama, sound, art, and even manages to create life to anuniqueandastounding trio of main charactersOverall,The House in Fata Morganais a no-brainer recommend, even with its flaws. If you enjoy an interesting, creative story, clever storytelling, stupidly deep character development or a magnificent atmosphere brought to life by what only aVisual Novelcan offer, then you should already have this in your library.I also highly suggest headphones and a dimly lit exterior for thesuperior experience.It does make a difference.Final Score:92/100Morgana is best girl",positive
The House in Fata Morgana,"Product received for freeFull review (including score):YouTubeâ¢ Video:Views: 0Written review below!The rundown:Pros:+ Unique art style+ Great use of atmosphere+ Excellent storyline+ God-tier soundtrackCons:- Rough first few chapters- Lossy soundtrack compressionThe House in Fata Morgana proved to be quite the journey for me. It took me nearly three months of on-and-off playing to finally clear, but in the end, it was totally worth it. Not only does the game provide an excellent story with a great sense of atmosphere, but it also does so with a unique art style and a soundtrack that quickly became one of my favorites.Pros:Unique art style.Most Japanese visual novels nowadays have a very distinct ""anime"" style, which, while not bad, can get a bit tiring, especially given the little difference between most of them.Â The House in Fata Morgana, on the other hand, immediately sets itself apart from the crowd by employing a unique gothic art style. The characters are drawn in such a way that they still look like they come from a visual novel, but they also have that stylistic gothic touch to them, creating this unique artistic blend that really lends itself well to establishing the game's dark atmosphere.It's not just the characters though, the background art also manages something similar. There are some scenes that take real-world environments and apply a stylistic filter, other scenes that are clearly drawn in the same vein as the game's characters, and even some more abstract scenes that help in conveying certain elements of the story. I had never played a game that looked quite like this, so it did take some getting used to, but I grew to appreciate how well it worked for the story it was trying to tell.Great use of atmosphere.On top of its unique art style,Â Fata Morgana also provides a dreary atmosphere to match it. In fact, I like to compare it to that of Danganronpa, but with one key difference. Whereas Danganronpa is a game where hope and despair clash,Â The House in Fata MorganaÂ is basically that, but without the hope. It's pretty much just constant despair with little sprinkles of hope scattered about.Not to say that that's a bad thing though, I actually felt like it made for a much better story. Being in a constant well of despair can really show the depths of the human heart, a topic that the game heavily focuses on. It touches on several serious topics as a result and there's a very good reason why there's a disclaimer at the beginning of the game despite being released as an ""all-ages"" title.Â The game really just takes full advantage of this atmosphere and manages to craft a brilliant story around it.Excellent storyline.Of course, the game's atmosphere would have been completely wasted had the storyline not been up to par, but fortunately,Â The House in Fata Morgana manages to do this and so much more. It provides a story full of well-written characters, takes place in a setting not often seen in the genre, and manages to maintain a certain degree of complexity without feeling convoluted. Considering how long the game is, that last point is actually rather impressive, as many visual novels tend to lose focus over the course of an extended runtime.Â Fata Morgana, on the other hand, manages to avoid this problem, fully developing its characters while at the same time maintaining a relatively steady, yet slow pace throughout. It makes for an exceptional story that is further bettered by its use of atmosphere.God-tier soundtrack.I am a huge fan of soundtracks for games, movies, TV, and other entertainment. I listen to them everyday, whether I be doing work, reading, or writing reviews like this. In fact, the genre has pretty much shaped my taste in music over the past several years. As such, I cannot overstate the genius behindÂ Fata Morgana's soundtrack.Â Simply put,Â The House in Fata MorganaÂ has one of the best soundtracks I have ever had the pleasure of listening to across any medium, be it movie, game, or otherwise.It's not only incredibly varied, but also perfectly matches the game's atmosphere. There's the somber, slow piano tunes, the ominous, atmospheric pieces, and even some more upbeat, colorful tracks for the few happy scenes in the game. On top of that, there are a bunch of vocal tracks mixed in there, some seemingly full of hope, and some that just bring you right back to despair. The game's soundtrack is as much a roller coaster as its story in terms of emotions.In fact, at times it even felt like the music was matching the pace of the events unfolding on-screen, creating a very immersive experience.Â Despite this, there were still several moments in the game where I stopped reading just to appreciate the music playing during that scene â it's just that good even on its own. This is not something I take lightly either, this is the kind of soundtrack I would compare other soundtracks against to judge their quality.Cons:Rough first few chapters.The House in Fata Morgana has a great overall story, but I can easily see why some would have a hard time getting past the first few chapters. This is because those first few chapters are rather rough to read. Not only are they incredibly slow-paced (although really, the entire game is pretty slow), but they also don't make much sense and appear to jump all over the place. In fact, these first few chapters are largely the reason why it took me so long to get through the game. It's definitely one of those games where most of the first half is used to setup the rest of the story, even if it comes at the cost of turning away potential readers. I won't go into further detail in order to avoid spoilers, but I will say that the game definitely does improve past those first few chapters, so don't let them scare you off.Lossy soundtrack compression.Despite all of the praise I've given the game's soundtrack, it unfortunately comes with one major drawback: that being that it is only available in a lossy format. This is incredibly disappointing to see, especially because this compression is quite noticeable on some tracks.You would think that this problem would be solved on the game's official soundtrack release, but it unfortunately is not. The quality is a bit better there, but is still about the same quality you'd get from a YouTube video. It's really just a shame that a soundtrack as good as this is barred behind a lossy master. Maybe one day we'll see a full lossless release, but as it stands, we're stuck with the compressed version.Overall:While the beginning may be a bit hard to get through, the overall story is definitely worth the read. From the game's unique art style, to its masterful use of atmosphere, there's really a lot to like here. On top of that, the soundtrack is one of the best I have ever listened to, both in and outside the medium. It's one of the more unsettling visual novels I've played, but it is masterfully crafted as such and definitely earns my recommendation.Follow mySteam Curator Pagefor more reviews + videos!",positive
The House in Fata Morgana,this vn wormed its way so deeply into my heart i barely have the words for it. actual peak. peak writing peak soundtrack peak characters peak peak peak i've never ever read anything like this. its so tender & so beautifully tragic and i deeply admire how it perfectly captures the sweetest And darkest parts of human nature. my favorite vn.,positive
The House in Fata Morgana,"The best story I have read in any form of media.It is not perfect, because, especially in the beginning, it is slow and not as well paced.I actually put it on pause after door 2, which is by far the weakest part of the story.However, if you manage to get through the first 3 doors, everything will start opening up (which is about 6-10 hours in, depending how fast you read) and will fall into place. Be mindful of this when going into the story.Other than that, I only have one thing to say:MAN . . . . . . . . ,  what a masterpiece.EDIT:If you have finished this game, know that there is an extra game/DLC called: The House in Fata Morgana: a requiem for innocence.Having just finished the DLC, I am happy to report that it managed to elevate this story to an even higher level. I don't know how they did it, but they did. And now I can say with full confidence:There will NEVER EVER be a story as good as The House in Fata Morgana.",positive
The House in Fata Morgana,"SPOILER FREE:The first 1/3rd of the game is really boring, I actually almost put down this VN because i was just bored.I had to start speeding through the text on like 50 lines at a time because I could tell that it was just repetitive dialogue.The second 1/3rd of the game is alright, it's when things that actually matter in the story start to be introducedThe third 1/3rd of the game is FANTASTIC, a beautiful story. Everything is connected, Beautiful.All in all, if you're willing to sit through 15hrs of underwhelming characters and boring dialogue (This game tends to turn a 1 line thing into 15 lines of the exact same sentiment written different ways), for a nice emotional payoff at the end, then I'd recommend.If you are not willing to sit through a bunch of (at the time) seemingly boring stories then I WOULD NOT pick this up.I feel the way this game builds its story is like instead of building a house from the bottom up, it first builds the roof, then builds the rest of the house, then connects the roof to the house.Thats one way of doing it...but while youre building the roof it feels pretty pointless at the time.",positive
The House in Fata Morgana,"IntroductionThe House in Fata Morganawas an incredible surprise for me, as visuals novel are not something I would actively seek to play. However, this game is the one that might change my mind, and I definitely want to play more similar games like that in the future. The gameâs story is amazingly written and has several interesting characters and thrilling plots, accompanied by an astonishing soundtrack and a beautiful art style.StoryAt the start, you wake up at a mysterious mansion with no memory of yourself whatsoever. However, you are not alone here. A woman, who calls herselfThe Maid, claims you should know each other, as you have been here before. In pursuit of regaining your memory, you followThe Maidthrough the mansion, where you witness multiple tragedies that happened to its previous residents throughout the years. What secrets do their stories hide? Why are you connected to this place? That is something you need to discover by yourself.The beginning slowly meanders until you get to your first twist. Once you get there, it is an astounding and thrilling ride to the very end. It is not an easy task to praise some stories without spoiling them, and that is even harder in the case ofThe House in Fata Morgana, as it has several plot twists and reveals throughout the whole game. Those twists do not appear out of thin air, as the game tends to give a few hints to its players beforehand. With this strong narrative and with the story hints the game provides, it is natural to create your own theories. While I managed to figure out some of the upcoming events, I was still surprised by how other situations played out in the end. That is definitely one of the biggest strengths of the game, as there are not any illogical twists just for the sake of having some.The Maid will guide you throughout the mansion. Will you follow her or give up?A Screenshot of The House in Fata MorganaBy:AviaRaCharacters are one of the main reasons why we love stories, and that is not different inThe House of Fata Morgana. There are several characters with different personalities. It does an impressive job of letting you understand the charactersâ motivation you might not like at the beginning. It is all about their point of view, which might not justify their actions, but at least you will understand their behaviour more. Throughout my playthrough, I felt sadness numerous times and even had to hold my tears with few moments. The game perfectly depicts what humans are capable of doing to each other, and while other games might hold off for a moment,The House in Fata Morganacontinues with its tragic events. So, the overall gameâs atmosphere is very dark, with numerous depressing scenes. However, there are several lighthearted and lovely moments due to which you will like some characters.If there is one thing I would change about the story, it is how it handled some of the explanations of reveals in the latter part of the game, as the game tends to reuse some of the scenes again to explain some twists. Yes, putting things in the context is important, however, when the plot comes with another plot twist, and you later witness the same situation for the third time, I begin to get a bit annoyed. I saw that already. I understand the context. Explain it swiftly! That being said, it is not a big problem, and perhaps that is just me, as I remember every tiny detail, but I would still prefer if some of the revealsâ explanations were a bit more merged.As the gameâs plot centers near the verge of Southern and Western Europe, it inspires itself in its history, especially with Christianity, which played an enormous role in the daily life of people before, and it is no different in the case ofThe House of Fata Morgana. However, do not expect strict historical drama or any dates and real personalities. The gameâs plot is fictional and even contains bits of unnatural elements.Knights in the service of Church are supposed to protect you.A Screenshot of The House in Fata MorganaBy:AviaRaThe game has several endings, so there are occasional choices. Some of them have a significant influence, while others do not. While I appreciate their presence, I never really felt that there were many difficult decisions I would have to think about, as I reached the true ending without reloading the game. The ending fits the gameâs narrative, and I was not disappointed. Everything important got properly explained, and I was satisfied with it. What can I say more? It is a long depressive journey that is definitely worth your time.AudiovisualsI adored every new picture and scene, as its design is distinctive and leans more towards serious themes without trying to make them look cute. As the plot centers itself in Western and Southern Europe, there are a few depictions of European Christian churches and symbols. Especially full-screen images, or so-called CGs, are incredibly beautiful, and you can check them in the main menu.What I fell in love the most in this game is its soundtrack. It manages to set the atmosphere for all of its dark moments, as well as the joyful ones. Some of the themes also change a bit throughout the story, and some of the songs feature bits of Portuguese, French, and Latin. You can also listen to the whole soundtrack in the main menu. However, the game itself is not voice acted, which in the end was better for me, as I could focus more on reading and listening to its wonderful soundtrack. There are occasional laughs and several more sound effects, though.The artists certainly deserve credit for their job.A Screenshot of The House in Fata MorganaBy:AviaRaPerformanceThe game was tested with ani5 8300H, GTX 1060 6GB, and 16GB RAM, running without any problems, at 1920x1080 resolution. However, to get such resolution, you have to go to the gameâsSteam Properties, into theBetassection, and select â1080p â 1080p version of the liveâ. Even then, you will still face black bars on the left and right sides. While the game is not unplayable, I would certainly appreciate it if worked normally, and that is definitely my biggest complaint about this game.ConclusionWith its dark, complex, and emotional story,The House in Fata Morganais a game that I will remember for a long time, and it definitely takes its rightful place among one of the best story-driven games I played. And that applies for its amazing soundtrack and art style, too! The aforementioned issues fade under the qualities this game has.Remember that Blue Lips Never Lie!

The House in Fata Morgana,"I don't typically review games very often. Every once in a while, however, I play (or in this case really, read) something that just utterly exceeds all of my expectations. Not to sound too arrogant, but seeing as how I've played many hundreds upon hundreds of games, this is harder and harder for a game to do for me.The House in Fata Morganais a visual novel that, even now (almost a full year after completing it), I have a hard time letting go of.Fata Morganais essentially a tragic love story that spans several centuries, intertwining the fates of numerous characters. It is difficult to say more than that, because this story has a myriad of twists, turns, and story subversion that even jaded ole me didn't see. What starts as an innocent looking game with a very unique art style (at least for Japanese visual novels) quickly transforms into...well, something else. The game delves into a myriad of very deep, dark, and tragic subject matters. While knowing what's in store is not truly a spoiler, some may prefer to be surprised. Thus, I will list the subjects the game covers in spoilers, and discuss each of them briefly:You are in for a story that covers:- IncestThis is not done in a way that most Japanese media might seem to portray it. It's not covered for very long, but what's there is very effective.- Sociopathy/psychosisA truly deep dive on what sociopaths experience can be found in this tale. It's probably the most objective look at what drives the darkness in the hearts of humanity.- Sexual AssaultThis particular subject will be very difficult for some to read. It is, however, executed with extreme realism and utmost respect. The build up and aftermath are truly haunting; it is not a plot device, used for vindicative reasons, or there to be tacky; rather, it is all in service to the overall theme of the story. Specifically, the focus is not on the vile act, but the mental scars thereafter.- Body dysmorphiaOnce again, this will be very difficult to read for some, but as someone who has never nor can never experience such a terrible thing, my heart literally ached. It's perhaps the most realistic and convincing depiction I've ever seen in media, along with every consequence of the subject.It covers these very heavy, very important topics and more, with exceeding respect and tonally correct realism. Honestly, this bittersweet tragedy devastated me, and I empathized greatly with the characters. For a company that usually localizes pornographic games, MangaGamer did an absolutely outstanding job translating this game into English. The text volume is daunting, yet the text remains superbly written on a high level - with basically no grammatical errors. This game puts most other Visual Novels (barring a few) - with their tropes and cookie-cutter scenarios - to great shame. The characters are all very human and not a single one of them lacks a flaw. It is an adult, mature story - I would certainly not recommend it for a younger audience.Not to be too cliche, butFata Morganashows us what Visual Novels could be, if they weren't wrapped up genre stereotypes and an otaku-pandering market. Though I found myself enjoying the illustrations, I feel that the story would have been done better justice as a traditional novel - though it would be quite a lengthy one. Player choices are very few, so not much would be lost in translation. It would be much easier to get my friends to read it, that's for sure.Despite the very heavy subject matter and depressing, gothic storyline, the game ends with a very realistic, satisfying conclusion. Without a doubt the best visual novel I've ever played and one of the best stories I've ever read, period. It took me a while to choose between the excellentSteins;Gateand this as my favorite, but this one wins out as the overall better tale.I have few minor complaints. The pacing can drag on and on and on, similar to the latter books in theA Song of Ice and Fireseries (where every detail is exhausted), and the art can vary between being pretty good and pretty bad. Additionally - and also as a bit of a heads up - the first four chapters are written much...differently...then the rest of the game. Without giving too much away, you could consider those an extended prologue of sorts - the 'quality' of the writing quadruples in short order, despite it being...'lower'...on purpose.Other than all that, if you are a fan of intriguing stories draped in human realism, then I highly recommend you scroll back up and hit that 'Add to Cart' button. I doubt you will regret it.",positive
The House in Fata Morgana,"DescriptionThe House in Fata Morgana is a visual novel that was written by Keika Hanada, developed by Novectacle and translated and published here by MangaGamer.Its impressively deep and tragic story spans a thousand year and has no less than 9 main characters (10 if you countthe White-Haired Girl and Morgana separately).It is a gothic horror and love story full of twists and turns and enough tragedy to fill many gothic novels.The game starts like a kinetic novel, with little to no choice, but do not let that fool you. While few and far between, the choices in this game are almost all very impactful, so much so they will often end the story right there. A bit of advice: save the game whenever you reach a choice and keep all those saves (you have way more than enough slots for that), especially if you want to later try to get all the achievements, as that will require you topretty much use all options in all choice screens.Trigger warning: while the visuals never get completely graphic, the text does describe many terrible acts and gory scenes in great details. Tread carefully.ProsAstounding story, full of tragedies, mysteries and surprisesAmazing soundtrack that really helps the script move the readerBeautiful art for the sprites and CGsA vast array of characters, each of which has many secrets to revealGreat writing (the style is always modern, regardless of the era, that is a choice made by both the original author and the translation team for the reader not to struggle with Middle Age speech and lose the thread of the story, having tried reading old texts in their original versions, I think it was a good choice on their part)Impressive length for a visual novelConsHigh chances that you will get depressed or want to curse all of mankind (or at least many of the characters) during the gameBackgrounds are nothing more than photographs with a splurging of filters on them and it shows... I would not have counted that as a con if the sprites and CGs did not put the backgrounds to shame (or if I had other bad things to say about this game)VerdictI sincerely regret that this is only a visual novel (note: there are a few drama CDs that MangaGamer might translate) and not a regular novel or an anime or a live action series... because I know that many of my relatives and friends who would tremendously enjoy the story will never give it a try in this form...That said, reading this Steam review, I can safely say that you are a gamer and interested in maybe buying this game, so that means you are part of the niche that visual novels target and thus part of the lucky few who will have the opportunity to discover this story.If you love visual novels, horror stories, love stories, tragedies... in fact, if you enjoy reading a good story with three dimensional characters struggling against the odds and their own nature, you owe it to yourself to try the House in Fata Morgana.But beware. The tragedies that unfold in this game, as the Maid would say, you will only be able to bear them because they are not yours... and if you have any empathy, then you will probably feel like some of those trials ARE yours. Even then, it is worth it.",positive
The House in Fata Morgana,"I've never played a visual novel before and I never really had an interest in them. A few friends kept screaming at me to try The House in Fata Morgana. Okay, okay. I'll try it.Just shy of 40 hours later and my life has changed forever. This game tore my heart to shreds with tragedy and rebuilt it piece by piece with love. I'm genuinely surprised by how compelling this story is. This game is definitely outside of my usual interests but I'm incredibly happy I stayed with it until the very end.My best advice for visual novel newbies trying this game is to 1. Save often, 2. Use your save slots, 3. Stick with it. The story is a slow burn but by the end of the game, you'll be absolutely shaken. Goddaaaaaamn.",positive
The House in Fata Morgana,"I was surprised to see that there wasn't any bad reviews for this visual novel, so I went ahead and bought it. The soundtrack is very beautiful. I really love the character art for House in Fata Morgana. You are the protagonist who is in a cursed mansion and you meet the Maid. Throughout the story, you are visiting the different years and learning about the past of others, and yourself, too. (I won't talk too much about the story to prevent from spoiling it). There isn't any voice acting, but it's still enjoyable. House in Fata Morgana has a great plot with some twists which it'll keep you wanting to read more until you reach the end! Gameplay is about 10 to 30 hours long depending on how fast you read. Check out the extras once you finished the game. Highly recommended!",positive

Designed with excellent (but sometimes tediously paced) prose, artfully sketched sprites, and an eerily enchanting and addictive vocalised OST, this VN is bold enough to stand against other monolith legends such as Umineko and Steins;Gate. More attention deserved for this heart-wrenching tale of forgiveness, sorrow and misery!",positive

The House in Fata Morgana,"I remember seeing this VN at one point on steam and deciding to just immediately pass it up. At the time I was looking for a new VN to play and this just didn't look very ""anime"" which is what I wanted at the time. I just thought it was some weird and creepy looking horror sham and I wrote it off.I wish I could go back and slap myself for being so stupid. Because not only is this the best VN I have read so far, I honestly think this is one of the best pieces of fiction I have ever had the pleasure of reading. This is a genuine suspenseful mystery story that really managed to bring out every kind of emotion from me.I love the mystery genre, especially mystery visual novels because I always feel like the payoff is always worth it in the end (I say ""in the end"" because most visual novels are long as â¥â¥â¥â¥). When someone is able to introduce something that I may not even figure out till the very end to result in me having my expectations completely destroyed is my favorite feeling. Fata Morgana was able  to do that and so much more. Not only was the mystery intriguing but the story itself turned out like nothing I could have imagined. I am a pretty easily emotional person already but I have to mention how good the ending really was and that it definitely had me crying.I also NEED to talk about the soundtrack. I probably talk about this with every VN I read because I honestly believe that pretty much every VN always has amazing music. That being said the music for this game is phenomenal, but I don't mean that in a way where you should search up the whole album and listen on your own. The music is something that perfectly compliments the visuals and writing. It creates such a rich and interesting atmosphere that its kind of hard to put into words. The music needs to be experienced as you progress through the story. Listening to the music after finishing just allows me to put my mind exactly when I first heard the song, how it made me feel, and what I remember happening at that moment in the story. Normally when I read VN's I do so while talking with friends, but I had to read this by myself to feel completely immersed with the sound as loud as possible. From the moment I started it up and the watercolor background came in of the rose garden in the first chapter with ""Ephemera"" playing; I knew this was something special that I had to savor on my own.Anyways just buy it. Sale or not 25 dollars is honestly such a steal for a story that is this good. I would love to do a much longer review at some point, but I don't want to leave any spoilers on the store page for this game. Thanks for reading my ramblings.",positive
The House in Fata Morgana,"Product received for freeAh yes, The House in Fata Morgana.The visual novel from a small developer, yet is sitting comfortably on the number one spot for ""Best Switch Video Games of All Time"" on Metacritic.The visual novel that doesn't have too many Steam reviews compared to the big dogs like Danganronpa and Ace Attorney, yet is always talked about, or atleast, is always being recommended.The visual novel that looks so different, even i didn't bother to buy it until my friend gifted it as a Christmas present.The praise, the hype, the ratings. They're overwhelmingly positive to the point you can't blame people for going in with high expectations.Does it deliver though?Yes. yes. All my yes.It really delivers and i can't stress this enough.BUT..... If you haven't read The House in Fata Morgana yet, i would suggest you to go try it yourself. Reviews are always nice and good to have, of course, but this is a prime example of a game you need to experience without any knowledge prior to reading it. If you want to read what i think about the game though, i'll let you through the door. I'm not stopping you.Here we go.The House in Fata Morgana is a tale of tragedy. It's grim, with little room for happiness. It's hopeless and depressing, i can't even emphathize with the characters. Not because i don't want to, but because it's just impossible to put myself in their shoes.""You were able to bear them because they weren't your tragedies,"" as one would say.But even so, am i really able to bear them if i'm sitting there, sobbing uncontrollably?-The House in Fata Morgana's use of different time and period is very satisfying and smart. Spanning a long period of time, you meet different set of characters in a different setting, each with their own circumstances. It's very refreshing, to be honest. Even though the amount of characters can lead to some of them being shallow or undeveloped, i think they're all fleshed out.When talking about ""long"", something i noticed is that, to some people it started off slow. Personally, The House in Fata Morgana gripped me from the start and never let go. Though, it's certainly true it gets significantly better at later parts. If you already enjoyed it even before the ""better parts"" i mentioned, you're going to have a blast. If not, hopefully you will.I very much appreciate the way the music evolves too following the time period. For example, you get some good catchy jazz music beyond the third door, which fits the era like a glove. In general, the OST is great. From ""Giselle"" to ""Serie de Fragmento"", from ""This Mutilated Body"" to ""Everybody's Crying"". I just adore them all. Thank you, composers.The artwork is stunning. It's just.... beautiful. Yes, i said i didn't bother to buy it because it looks different. But do note that it's because i thought it was a pure horror visual novel, which i can't really stomach. It is horror, though i spent more time crying rather than being scared. After reading more and more, i learned to appreciate the art more and i can't imagine The House in Fata Morgana having different artstyle.With all the basic stuff reviewed, i wholeheartedly recommend you to experience The House in Fata Morgana. Oh, and A Requiem for Innocence to top it off.I enjoyed Requiem as much as i enjoyed the first entry for the Fata Morgana series. It's such a bummer that Reincarnation isn't available on Steam. Therefore, i can't give my impressions for that game.END NOTE: A day ago, July 17 to be exact, Keika Hanada, writer for the visual novel wrote a blog post about Fata Morgana. From what i've read, he's very humble and he is also surprised to find out the visual novel is number one on Metacritic.  Because of this score, Fata Morgana sales have increased on Steam and sales on Switch exceeded expectations. This is incredible news, because both sales literally saved the company from going under. And now, the team and himself can work on their new upcoming project (a game other than NarKarma EngineA, apparently). Well, whatever it is, i'm so happy for them and will buy the game day one!Goodbye for now, The House in Fata Morgana and Novectacle.Until our souls cross paths once more in the boundless sphere of fate.",positive

The House in Fata Morgana,"Playing The House in Fata Morgana was quite the emotional rollercoaster.  Much of the game is, in all honesty, quite grim.  However, there are moments of wholesomeness that shine like a light in darkness.The story was simply a masterpiece.  Following a MC that awakens in a mysterious manor with no memory of who they are, they must plunge through the history of the manor and uncover the truth both of themselves and the manor, with only a strange Maid to help them get their bearings.  You'll find that the story never gets dull or drags as the game progresses, keeping things fresh with different OST's (the absolute best soundtrack of any visual novel I have ever played) to fit the evolving theme of the game, characters that have depth and are well designed to fit the times they lived in, and settings that change as you progress through the game.If you are looking for a VN that is not afraid to crush your spirit as you play, that also has very good music, this is the game. 10/10",positive
The House in Fata Morgana,"When I initially bought this - I thought this visual novel was a lower tier VN. The kind that has one singular plot with one linear story with a few plot twists. A play once and put back on the shelf to be checked off as a ""Completed"" kind of game.Good lord, never have I ever been more delighted to be COMPLETELY WRONG.This game takes what knowledge and understanding you have of characters and events and absolutely LOVES turning it on its head - introducing new information, new perspectives, and new styles of storytelling. It's a large narrative connected by many other stories that have their own characters and I cannot express enough my love for some of the story segments in this game.There's so much that's unraveled in the game - even YOU don't know who you are in this complex tale.TL;DR: This game is not at all what you are expecting - the creators themselves have said they ""love misleading the audience"" and they have accomplished that incredibly well on MANY occasions.",positive
The House in Fata Morgana,"I finished The House in Fata Morgana at 2:30 on a Sunday morning. Once I entered the fifth door, I couldnât stop reading (and crying).Iâm starting to wonder if my favorite games donât really have a specific genre or gameplay mechanic in common. All I need to see is every review telling me not to spoil myself and go in without any idea other than the premise, which might not be enough for someone who is about to invest 40-50 hours of their time in a game. If youâre one of those people on the fence, I fully understand, but I love stories I wish I could experience for the first time again. And the way to get the most impact is by not spoiling yourself any further than what the synopsis gives you. This story in particular unravels beautifully.YouTubeâ¢ Video:Angel Olsen - Hi-Five (Official Video)Views: 1,271,090Angel Olsen 'Burn Your Fire For No Witness', out Feb. 18 2014, on CD/ LP/ Digital on Jagjaguwar. Pre-Order 'Burn Your Fire For No Witness' at: iTunes: http://smarturl.it/angelolsen_itunes // Amazon:...The soundtrack is easily in my top five video game OSTs, especially Yusuke Tsutsumiâs songs in the latter half of the game. The songs feel like they were written and performed by the characters themselves. Some of the most harrowing classical music and my only piece of advice I will give is to please play this with the sound on. Unfortunately, there is no voice acting, but I actually didnât notice until I recommended Fata Morgana to a few people, and they asked.YouTubeâ¢ Video:Emma Ruth Rundle - Return (Official Video)Views: 363,347From the upcoming album ""Engine of Hell"", out 11/05 on Sargent House Pre-Order / Download / Stream: https://ffm.to/err-eoh Cast Angel / Death - Emma Ruth Rundle Angel / Death Double - Sarah...And the storyâ¦ This is quite possibly the best love story Iâve ever read. I loved how the relationship developed. Thereâs a bit of cheesy dialogue enmeshed with more serious topics, but it still felt real. There are a total of eight doors (or chapters). The first four are very clear cut but once you enter door five, the story really expands. I began to forget which door I was in, which I think is by design.YouTubeâ¢ Video:Mr Twin Sister - Lady DaydreamViews: 637,776Dreamy throwback to my favorite song by Mr Twin Sister, from the 2010 album ""Color Your Life."" http://mrtwinsister.com https://facebook.com/mrtwinsister https://mrtwinsister.bandcamp.com...The protagonist is an unlikely one. I actually wasnât sure who WAS the main character. You learn in the beginning that you are the master but as you go through each doorâs memories, itâs unclear how you are related to these memories. Are you part of them? Or are these moments in history until you came back again? So many questions swirl in your head, and the game provides excellent foreshadowing, and I did not leave with any questions unanswered.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVhXfy56xdgI only have two critiques, the first is some of the writing can be very long winded. The story is strong enough that additional explanations behind some of the characterâs decisions are unnecessary. To be completely fair, I experience this with most visual novels, and I realize this critique is based more on personal preference. Why waste time say lot word when few word do trick?The second is that sometimes the story feels very forced. There are times I can tell the writing wants me to feel empathy for certain characters, but I just canât. The story will make you question your own morality, and I wish I could be as forgiving as some of the characters, but I am not a saint.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m2NyS3IDjE10/10, would be emotionally devastated again",positive
The House in Fata Morgana,"Given the remarkable number of positive reviews for Fata Morgana, I will first advise some caution. Temper your expectations. Try to go in as blind as possible and make your own opinion. It's easy to read the thoughts, feelings and opinions of others and be swayed by the manic joy, to feel their glee and readily accept it as your own. Will you begin this tale, your mind already sullied by the jubilant masses? Or will you choose to create your own perspective? And is such a thing even possible in this day and age, where with the press of a button, you are exposed to an unimaginable number of people's thoughts, hopes and dreams?There is so much that could be talked about regarding Fata Morgana, and discussing even a fraction of it poses the risks of spoilers, so if you have even a passing interest in reading Fata Morgana, I highly recommend distancing yourself from the steam review page and picking it up for yourself.With that said... If reading was a boss fight, Fata Morgana would be it.This is undoubtedly one of the greatest stories I have ever read. Yes, there is an immense amount of praise for this visual novel, and yes a vast majority of it is well-deserved and spot on. The art, writing and music all work in tandem together to create an unforgettable, gripping tale of love, loss, grief and reconciliation.In terms of writing depth, Fata Morgana has some of the sharpest, most actualized character writing I've ever experienced in a work of fiction. That depth only increases further and further you get into the game, and once the mystery begins being solved, you will discover that it is very much intentional design. The story is very easy to follow along, but there's an incredible amount of hidden detail that can pass by you, especially as your progress along the True End route. And catching these details clues you in that there is something more to what's going on.There are several points where the story weaponizes how Visual Novels work against you, and if you aren't focused or paying attention, it will trap you. And coming to that realization was one of the most cathartic feelings I've felt reading a novel ever since Steins;Gate's. This story, in the best sense of the word, tries to gaslight you. From the moment you boot the game up and begin reading, you are already an essential part of its plot. Whether or not you can realize the truth and are exposed to the mid-game twist reveal is up to you. This might honestly be Fata Morgana's strongest element; Fata Morgana directly challenges your ability to believe what you are told, and whether or not you take things at face value, and your actual skill in reading comprehension is tested throughout the entire front half of the novel. It's delightfully brilliant. Fata Morgana takes full advantage of the visual novel medium, even utilizing the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ BACKLOG as a weapon to pull the wool over your eyes, to fool you into believing one thing is reality when the truth is far more sinister.If reading was a boss fight, Fata Morgana would be it.",positive
The House in Fata Morgana,"(don't mind my few hours of play, I played on psvita)This is my favourite VN and my favourite story among all media.You just have to endure a slow start and then you will find a series of events, twists and characters that will remain imprinted on you for years.It has the best soundtrack listened in a VG along with Castlevania SOTN.Reading ""A Requiem for Innocence"" is recommended to understand the full story",positive
The House in Fata Morgana,"This is THE Magnum Opus of video games, and the SINGLE MOST BREATHTAKINGLY BEAUTIFUL STORY that I've ever experienced.  With a soundtrack that could have been composed by angels, and makes you feel as if you've died and gone to heaven.",positive
The House in Fata Morgana,"Good lord what a masterpiece.It's difficult to go in depth as to WHY exactly this game is as amazing as it is, as fully disclosing the spoilers of the game is necessary in understanding the true merit of it because of the game's intricately woven web of mysteries. But I shall do my best regardless.To put it simply, The House in Fata Morgana is an epic tale that feels more like an opera than a traditional novel. The first thing that must be said is that the soundtrack is simply amazing, full marks goes to whoever decided that they would subsitute the lack of voice acting with incredible vocal tracks which is what gives it that opera feeling. Another immediate thing to note is the game's art style, which is dark, realistitc, and, well, more ""western"" as opposed to the usual anime style found in 99% of visual novels. Personally, I much prefer Fata Morgana's approach.The game's primary appeal is of course in the plot, which far surpassed my expectations. Ultimately a tale of human nature, it drags you to the depths of despair and then brings you to the highest peaks of hope, only to cast you back down into the pit.One element that I found to be a great boon in the story is that each character has a core theme (for example, Mell's theme being the desire to be loved, Yukimasa's theme being personal boundaries, Michel's theme beingblurring of mortal and divine traits) so the characters all serve a clear purpose in the holistic thematic scheme. At the same time however, all of the characters are believable and behave in a genuinely human (if extremely flawed) manner, allowing for legitimate empathy. Walking the line between having your characters serve a theme and be realistic (allowing for empathy) is a tough act, one which Fata Morgana pulls off almost flawlessly. I mean, the game made me sympathize with a man who regularly verbally (and occasionally physically) abuses his wife, Witcher 3 style.The mystery aspect of the game was played perfectly in my opinion, there were about 4-5 instances where the game could have ended and it could have been considered ""complete"" by normal game standards, but then it brings up an unsolved piece of the puzzle that you had forgotten about and keep going, pulling you back in just when it seemed to be resolved. This game is also likes its dark theme, dealing with some very heavy ideas such as, but not limited to: insanity, manical vengence, child slavery, non-consenual intercourse (Steam censors rape I have to explain it somehow ok), spouse abuse, incest, religious fanaticism, psychopathy, and evenintersex discrimination.The actual structure of the game's plot is another high point in my opinion, with the first half of the game dealing with the tales of the mansion's previous owners throughout history, all of which could be standalone stories in their own rights. But halfway through the game the true plot begins, and the way in which the game continues to unravel the mysteries while raising new questions only to show how it is all connected in the end amazes me. The substories contribute to making an even better overall story, and it works.That is not to say that it's without its faults though. There are a few hiccups in the story, and the pacing of Chapter 6 until about the middle of Chapter 7 is dreadfully slow. Aside from that however, there are no complaints that go beyond nitpicking.Overall, The House in Fata Morgana is a journey. A journey throughout history, and a journey through humanity, all the highs, lows, and everything inbetween. I cannot recommend this enough to anyone with an even slight tolerance for visual novels, or an appreciation of the art of storytelling.Oh, and did I mention that the ending left me a sobbing â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ wreck of a man, despite considering myself to be extremely resliant emotionally?Once Giselle (the song) started playing I couldn't hold it in anymore and completely crumbled. Yeah. Please do youreslf a favor and play this game.",positive
The House in Fata Morgana,"In the middle of playing this I feel like I was reading something made by shakespear or true fairy tales, those non-disney versions that don't always have a happy ending and have some disturbing stuff in them.Overall it was an amazing story but it does take a while to get to the main story not to say the opening act wasn't interesting it just didn't sink in yet until I found out who the protagonist was.There are 8 endings in this game so there are some choices, you just won't be able to make most of those choices in the 1st half of the game.The soundtrack for this game is varied and original (as far as I know) with each era having different vibes to it. Most of the songs are sung in Portuguese with a bit of French and Latin in some songs so I had no idea what they were saying one bit but it was still lovely XD",positive
The House in Fata Morgana,"A modern masterpiece, The House in Fata Morgana is a visual novel about the tragedies surrounding an old mansion, and all the complex human relationships that led to those tragedies. To say that this VN is well-written is an understatement; it may in fact be one of the best stories I've ever read.In my opinion, this is a wonderful starting VN for those new to the genre and everyone who likes character drama games like the Telltale games and Life is Strange should check out Fata Morgana, as it easily blows those games out of the water. Fata Morgana does not use an anime artstyle, nor does it use cliche anime tropes. Instead, it is heavily western-inspired and focuses on relatable, flawed people, making it a very immersive story.To say any more will spoil the mystery, as this is a VN that has many twists and turns. There's a reason why this has 100% positive reviews, because it's just that damn good.",positive
The House in Fata Morgana,"Really good VN. Fantastic and unique art and music. Not perfect but pretty dang good writing too, very dramatic. I thought I realized where it was goin pre early on, I didn't, it gets crazy. I played in Japanese which is my 2nd language, so for anyone who is also in that position, if I had to try and gauge the difficulty of it language wise, maybe a 7/10? There's a lot of unique kanji, some obscure ones, some archaic terms and ways of speaking, philosophical concepts are explored, but aside from that there's not too much that is conceptually difficult (like deep magic systems or sci-fi stuff,) so overall I think it's fairly understandable if you're at least decent at the language, and will be a place where you can learn some stuff too.",positive

The House in Fata Morgana,"The House in Fata Morgana is an intimate story of pure love. One that conveys love in its ugliest and most passionate form, it's far from a conventional story, but a rewarding experience nonetheless.An essential visual novel that even after half a decade of pursuing the medium as much as possible (on my end) showcases how much it still has to offer after so many years of experience. This is for me one of the best-constructed stories I have ever read, not a single aspect of this work feels wasted and everything comes back in some form, the utilization of the ""anthology"" visual novel is single-handedly the most creative use of this format that I have ever seen across all mediums. How they found a way to fit the first three disconnected stories and place them all into an actual narrative is nothing less than masterful and has me excited for whatever future works this author creates. The emotions of this work are insanely high as well, with some of the most passionate displays of pure love throughout this work and despite this beauty, a lot of ugliness is portrayed along with it. How characters oftentimes let their insecurities eat at them until they cause their own ruin, not realizing that the things they seek to protect are as fragile as themselves only illustrates the point of how much love breeds self-destruction. To learn to love something also means that one has the ability to protect it in whatever form they see fit, and this form will manifest into the ugliest versions of the people seeking to protect it.It's hard to say Fata Morgana has a definitive theme, there are many things to consider such as despair versus optimism, insanity, the importance of communication, the beauty and ugliness of love, self-hatred, redemption, and the burdens of responsibility. But despite this, the theme that resonated most with me is the idea of escapism, how characters will shield themselves from pain in order to protect their love for someone, not realizing that this ""love"" is in itself toxic. How characters such as Jacopo fear the answers of a person that has yet to speak to him, how lovers like Giselle present a fake story to the person she cares for most to ""protect"" her man, and how witches like Morgana lets people walk all over her and tries justifying it under an ""umbrella"" of her duty leading to her ultimate hatred. This for me is the visual novel that best exemplifies how people would rather escape from reality than face their own insecurities head on and despite this, they can move forward. That's the beauty of this work, it never puts a definitive exclamation point on a characters story, they can evolve and learn as much as they make mistakes and I think for me, that's the theme that will stay with me years from finishing this. Human potential allows us to change as much as we hurt others, simply punishing those that hurt you will only lead to a cycle of hatred, this is the ultimate form of escapism. Choosing to believe people made their horrible choices purely to spite you without knowing who they are, escaping into the easier answer to accept, the easiest pill to swallow, when human beings are far more than that. Fata Morgana fights against this idea without compromising its character writing, story, or identity. The character writing is masterful and by the end of this story, most characters feel fully realized even if I don't love them equally. Michel, Giselle, and Jacopo are characters that would top most tier lists for me, the amount of passion put into crafting their development is the strongest showcase of this author's ability to write flawed characters whose love becomes corrupted.The story is magnificent, imaginative, and an amazing utilization of the medium, Chapter 4 is amongst the best ideas I've seen in a visual novel. The identity of this work will never be replicated as well, it's unique to its own, this almost feels like a culmination of several VN ideas I love fully realized into a singular vision that still doesn't feel replicable. It's familiar, but not something I could say I'll ever see executed the same way again. How Fata Morgana manages to convey its story is nothing less than a calculated miracle, it's the embodiment of artistic ambition being fully realized.",positive
The House in Fata Morgana,"This is a story of the vicissitude of fortune, constant reversals and never fading hatred, curse, and even more resilient love. After a pretty long foreshadowing, secret connections will be revealed, and you will be surprised by how separated people are bound together by the thread of fate. Viewing through different person grants you different parts of a whole puzzle and finally, salvation awaits, for every last of them, all by your hand.""Farewell, until our souls cross paths once more in the boundless sphere of fate.""",positive
The House in Fata Morgana,"I teared up several times and actually cried once while playing this game. It was way beyond my expectation. I wish I could play the game again with first encounter experience just to be impressed by the plot revealing one more time.The story is amazing and beautifully narrated. I suggest anyone who interest to dive into the game as blindly as possible. The more unknown about it, the more impact it will be. I myself felt it like that.To be honest, I was not familiar with the art style but growing to love it in the end. The gorgeous art suited the eerie/gothic atmosphere very much which is great. More to that, I would like to point out the awesome music. I appreciated dev team for making soundtracks this beautiful, such ear blessing.Only one thing that lacking is the game was not voiced. And I would be glad if there will be voice patch in the future.For short, this is one of the best story VN I have played in my life. Definitely be top ranking in my list. 10/10 would recommended this masterpiece.Just remember that ""You were able to bear them because they were not your tragedies""",positive
The House in Fata Morgana,"I finished this VN over a week ago, and I literally think about it every day, and I know I will for many days yet to come.I think about the characters, the story, the music, the setting, the plot, the world, everything about this visual novel has me completely floored.Every part of this visual novel is perfect, and I cannot help but feel as if while reading it I felt every single human emotion imaginable. This is a piece of art that transcends the medium and even people typically not into visual novels could appreciate.It has a very unique setting especially for a visual novel and very atmospheric and heavy tone throughout, yet it is not totally devoid of light or hope. There is always something pushing You forward.While some of the early chapters may appear to lack an overall narrative structure and appear more as short stories and seem very disconnected they are, instead, eventually tied together in the such an incredible way that I was completely unprepared for.The tragedies that lie behind the doors are heart breaking only because you feel such a strong attachment for these characters. A desire for them to do better and be better than they even are, BUT EVERYTHING KEEPS GOING WRONG IN THE MOST HORRIBLE WAY AND YOU HAVE TO KEEP READING!I cannot help but gush about this visual novel, and my only regret is that I finished before any of my irl friends so I have no one to talk to about the ending.I truly believe with my whole heart and soul that this is one of the greatest pieces of literature/media in human history and that is no exaggeration. I don't use nor like the term peak fiction in most instances but The House in Fata Morgana is truly deserving of the title.",positive
The House in Fata Morgana,10 doors out of 10,positive
The House in Fata Morgana,This is my favourite visual novel ever and I bet I will remember this game when I'm old. The story unfolds into a powerful and emotional punch into the player's heart.,positive
The House in Fata Morgana,"The House in Fata Morgana is way, way, way too long.Essentially the game is 4 stories set in and around a haunted house over different historical eras. Three of those stories are told in the first few hours of the game, and once you've played through those, you've basically seen everything the game has to offer. The fourth story is about how the protagonist came to be in the house and delves into the nature of the curse.The problem with the pacing is after you know all four stories, the game just repeats them again, and again, and then - just when you think it's done - you have to go through it all again. The trick is that each time you get to see it from the eyes of a different character, and supposedly that gives you a deeper insight into their horrific behavior (torture, rape, murder etc). In reality it's just boring, because already in the very first story you learn the ""moral"": every person who does awful things has some â¥â¥â¥â¥ in their past that pushed them to behave that way.It is so trite. If this game was 4 hours long, it might've been a decent VN. Even with the florid and overworked prose, even with the stereotyped characters (women are either submissive or scheming, men are either violent or brooding), the music and art is fantastic and well worth the money. But spending another 10+ hours after the core story was already told getting hit over the head again and again with the same message really ruins anything it had going for it.",negative
The House in Fata Morgana,"So I know exactly what you're thinking.You saw the the promo image that they used to show the game's title, and thought ""This is going to be pandering ship tease between two women just like a lot of the other visual novels on steam, that has a bunch of indecent CG's, and generally does the relationship between them no justice whatsoever. I am not the market for this game"".This could literally not be more wrong in every aspect. The promo image is misleading.You may have then scrolled down to read the description, and thought ""Ahhh, so this is actually a collection of short stories that are unrelated to each other, that then leads to a minor payoff at the end as the player chooses an ending at the last minute.""This is also wrong. The description is misleading.You may have even read other reviews here, and formed some sort of opinion as to what the game may be about.I don't know what that is, but it's probably wrong, since most reviews skirt around the plot, and as a result... are misleading.The House in Fata Morgana is not your average visual novel. It can not be neatly defined as a pure romance, or horror, or comedy, or even a tragic story, and it would not be fair to describe the characters within it using visual novel tropes, even if it contains all of these elements to different degrees. First and foremost, Fata Morgana is a story. And a well written one at that....Like everyone else here, I can't really say too much more. The fact that you may still not be exactly sure what the plot is about is only to your benefit. That being said, the art only improves as the game goes on (some sprites/cgs are downright beautiful), and the music is fantastic. Please buy it if you have any interest in good stories at all. It's worth *insert monetary value here*. Because I would have gladly paid more than full price.",positive
The House in Fata Morgana,This is the best visual novel I have ever played in my life. Everything is 10/10. The music. The art. The characters. The plot. The writing. My life is now divided into two parts: before THIFG and after THIFG. This changed me fundamentally. I played this three years ago and not a day goes by where I don't think about it. Fight through the first three doors for the love of God I'm begging you. Play this game. If you ever listen to a review on anything let it be this one. Play The House in Fata Morgana.,positive
The House in Fata Morgana,"The House in Fata Morgana, from its beautiful soundtrack to its deeply human characters, is a real masterpiece.I was never a big fan of visual novels, but I was drawn to this one because of its Gothic setting and beautiful art style and bought it without much of a second thought. To say that I was not disappointed would be quite the understatement as this game has not only become my favourite novel, but one of my favourite games of all time.The House in Fata Morganaâs story, from quite unsettling, to heartbreaking and to deeply touching, is one of the best I have ever read. I found myself completely immersed and needing to know every detail right from itâs first chapter, and it, at my surprise, only got better and better. The one thing I did find disappointing when it came to the story, was a plot point quite far into the game that I foundâ¦ a little lackluster? But other than that, I have absolutely no complaints.The characters are this novelâs strongest point, though. They make deeply human mistakes in sometimes the most realistic of ways. Characters you feel nothing for or are unsettled by in the beginning might become the ones you feel closest to and understand the most in the end, and vice-versa. Within this game, I found characters I could relate to on a level I never had in any form of media before, and because of that, The House in Fata Morgana definitely feels very special.The gameplay is definitely an experience more like reading a long novel, with an added great soundtrack and gorgeous art style. Unlike most visual novels Iâve played, this one doesnât have all that much when it comes to choice, which to me, isnât a bad thing. You do not have to constantly worry about every action you take and every choice you make, and can simply sit back and enjoy the story with a few choices sprinkled in between. The game also gives you lots of different save slots, which is very useful and I would recommend you take advantage of if you plan on going back to get all of the endings.I donât think I could praise this game enough to convey how I truly feel about it but I would absolutely recommend The House in Fata Morgana to anyone even mildly interested in picking it up, visual novel fan or not, as it is one hell of a hidden gem.",positive
The House in Fata Morgana,"I have never written a review, nor did I plan to until this game released on steam. It's an absolutely breath-taking story. Most Visual Novels I have played are very straight-forward, not much inclination on the choices and overall predictable stories. But enjoyable none the less.This game however. I cannot stress enough how this game takes Visual Novel into a whole new dimension. The choice making is very critical in thinking and reaction. I want to say this without spoiling it. Because the feature was incredible to me, and worth just experiencing with a virgin play-through.I've never liked characters from a Visual Novel as much as I liked the cast of this one. They're relatable and so very human.I'm just going to say BUY THIS GAME if you are a mature Visual Novel lover. It's very worth the 25$ I would have paid 60$ for it. As the hours it takes to complete for an average read speed is around 25hrs. Not including all endings and Extras. Is worth a full price to me.Also a side note on the OST:The OST is truly emotional and fits the situations in the game very well, they fade out and match the feeling of every sentence the characters say through the game and also have beautiful vocals and instrumentals. I have many of the songs on my playlist and listen to them daily.Please consider this game. It's a true diamond in all the moe crap Visual Novels that keep being released.",positive
The House in Fata Morgana,"Because of the high regard that people around me gave this game, I read the novel with criticism in mind. Just to forget that I was trying to be a contrarian and proceed to praise how they handle the script, pacing, and plot so well. The story also tackles certain sensitive topics with such care that it does not need to shove it on the readers mouth and let the complexity and beauty of the dialogues offer the reader a new perspective.this VN is deeply...human. It is one of, if not the best written story I have ever read.10/10 and as we call it on recent terms, an ABSOLUTE CINEMA",positive
The House in Fata Morgana,"One of the best Visual Novels ever, and the best written romance between 2 characters I've ever read.

The House in Fata Morgana,"As Visual Novels go, House in Fata Morgana is really very good. It is though, definitively I think, a work of fiction you'll discover that you either love or hate fairly quickly, as the art style, writing, and plot are all very polarizing in difference from what you might be used to from top selling VNs with a similar rating (Rewrite, Umineko, Steins;Gate, etc.).STORY: The story here is truly enjoyable, the writing is easily digestible and does a fantastic job at slowly unraveling and deconstructing a complex plot spanning space and time at a pace that always minds itself, never revealing too much too quickly and at the same time not dragging on and on. The plot is mischievously misleading, for every twist making you groan in mock agony that you see coming a mile away, Fata Morgana surprises with more and more that take you entirely by surprise. This is not to say the writing is without flaws;Fata Morgana is, quite frankly, a mostly depressing novel. This isn't inherently an issue though the flowery prose of the writing sometimes fights the overall tone of the plot to it's very occasional detriment by not knowing when to take a more serious tone, there are a very negligible amount of typos in this translation and (thankfully) only one abhorrently bad translator joke that I could find in around 30 hours.My only real gripe with the story itself is with one of the biggest twists of the game [very minor spoilers]regarding the protagonist, one experienced towards the end and one that becomes an integral theme of the game as a whole, feels just a bit flat in the current year 2020. I imagine when the game was released in its home country 8 years ago it was intended to be a fairly groundbreaking stinger but feels a little milquetoast in the west in the current year.ART: The art style is beyond lovely, the artist Moyataro paints gothic stills full of emotion that perfectly capture the tone of the story and are just wonderful to look at, the only criticism being that there isn't more of it. Different frames can sometimes be few and far between and I think the story would greatly benefit from more to look at.MUSIC: Something this game has in abundance, however, is music. Fata Morgana has a *massive* OST and is one of my absolute favorites in recent memory, VN or otherwise. The several composers that put in work on this game put far more love into its' OST than was probably necessary for whatever they were paid and it really shows in an immersive soundtrack that NEVER fails to complement the story wonderfully, really driving the emotion behind every part of the game.Score: 8.5/10Overall, Fata Morgana is a must-play VN that is worth every penny of the sticker price and cannot be ignored if on sale. The only proviso being that is, in the end, just an enjoyable story. I see many comments praising it as a new gospel, a life-changing piece of media, Fata Morgana is certainly not all that but deserves to be enjoyed all the same.",positive

The House in Fata Morgana,"My most favourite VN that I have read. It was just something, I'm emotionally exhausted. For the last 5-10 hours, a light impulse was enough to make the eyes wet.

The House in Fata Morgana,"Astonishing game.  Give it patience, and you'll find an emotional masterpiece with almost unmatched power.   Get past the PAINFULLY slow chapter one... once you're past the first hour or two, WHOOOO BOY brace yourself.  The writing, while sometimes needlessly over-the-top verbose, is so good in total it's ""re-examine your own life"" epic.  The HARD LEFT TURN the story makes after the fourth chapter: genius.  In fact all the reveals are inspired.  Music: quite simply the finest soundtrack (outside of chapter one, which was absolutely obnoxious) I've ever heard in a game.   The music by itself will bring the tears in chapter four and the final 10%, it's that powerful.    You just gotta get past chapter one.  I promise you, your patience will be well rewarded....    has the most satisfying true ending I've ever come across.",positive
The House in Fata Morgana,"Not being much of a visual novel guy, nor much of a Steam reviewer, I'm quite surprised to find myself penning a review of a VN. However, this game seems to becriminallyoverlooked (judging by the quantity of reviews). I don't know much about people's usual VN tastes, but the lack of an anime artstyle seems to be a turn-off for most people. For me, though, it was an absolute breath of fresh air, as was the superb soundtrack.As far as VNs go, this one is almost mastercrafted - the only misstep to speak of is perhaps frontloading the least interesting of its stories. If you're in the market for some gothic horror with a leisurely pace (in a good way, for once) and a heaping helping of twists,buy this game.However, it must be said that the game deals with themes some may find confronting, such as sexual assault.

Get the soundtrack too while you're at it because it's GORGEOUS, barring a few of the more obnoxiously ""twee"" sounding tracks which unfortunately all seem to occur in the first chapter of the game.Maybe you're not into gothic horror stories where everyone's in ornate period costumes. Maybe you're put off by the emphasis on blood and gore in the promotional material. Maybe you're afraid this game might turn out to be a trite gothic maid waifu simulator. But let me tell you: if you're into well-paced, slowburn stories about both the best and worst that humanity can be, with characters that you can both love AND hate AND understand at the same time, then The House in Fata Morgana will definitely scratch that itch for you.also: maids o:",positive
The House in Fata Morgana,"The House in Fata Morgana is a glorious Japanese Visual Novel set in a western setting that takes about 30 to 40ish hours to complete. The game features a few choices, most of them in the later part of the game; itâs a pretty linear narrative with different dead ends. The gothic mystery induced narrative revolves around a cursed mansion set in different time periods, as it explores themes of, for instance, human nature, insanity, love and hatred. It manages skillfully, overall, to go between bright, life-giving sequences on the one hand and dark desolate ones on the other.The soundscape supports the narrative in a most beautiful way and some of the tracks have vocals in different languages like Portuguese and Latin, that provide a most wondrous ambience to different scenes.The Writing/translation seems to be good overall, though itâll use âheheâ to express laughter, while rarely itâll describe it instead as is leaps and bounds more appropriate, just to mock me no doubt. For the love of humanity who do I have to tickle to death? Seriously.

The story is probably the best and most beautiful I've ever read, and it left me crying harder and more often than any other story I've ever read. It's both soul-crushing and healing to the extreme, taking you for a truly insane emotional ride you'll never regret.

The House in Fata Morgana,"What drew me into this game was that out of all the visual novels ever created, this one is the highest rated on Metacritic. At the time of writing, The House in Fata Morgana is the 25th highest rated game of all time on Metacritic, beating out games like Elden Ring, Skyrim and Persona 5 Royal. Although that release of the game is actually the Nintendo Switch version  (a newer release that is much better quality than the steam release), I recommend downloading a free patch called THiFM: Remaid of Dreams so that you can play the Nintendo Switch version of the game on the steam release. Anyways,What makes this game the 25th highest rated game of all time on Metacritic?The Story: 10/10The first 3 chapters (or doors if you played the game), were slow at times, but the game rewards your patience with absolutely brilliant storytelling in the last 4 chapters of the game. If you have the patience to read for ~10 hours, then you will be rewarded in the 2nd half of the game.The Characters: 10/10Undoubtedly the strongest aspect of the game. The characters are well written and sympathetic given the tragedies all of them had to go through.Art: SubjectiveThis visual novel stays away from the usual anime art style of the genre and adopts a more naturalist art style. I think the art style is why the game is able to be so highly rated on Metacritic; other highly rated visual novels like Umineko or Higurashi are nowhere to be found presumably because of their usual anime art style.The House in Fata Morgana is a well-written visual novel that I would recommend to people who have already played a visual novel. If this is your 1st visual novel, then perhaps you will be disappointed since visual novels are for people who like reading novels with some very minor gameplay. This game supposedly being the 25th greatest game of all time can be misleading because of it's medium, but as a piece of fiction, it's fantastic.",positive
The House in Fata Morgana,"Now that I'm finally done with The House in Fata Morgana I have decided to gather my thoughts on it.The House of Fata Morgana is really good visual novel that oozes atmosphere and doesn't go with a cliche anime visual style. A story that is pretty gruesome but it can have some light hearted moments to strike a decent contrast to the despair and messed up things to happen in the game. The whole cast has a purpose to being there and you will feel sad or hatred towards some of the characters which for most of the part seem intentional. The many endings and dead ends are mostly interesting and there is some extra dialogue on a few areas in the game if you play for the second time. Let's not forget one of the biggest stars in the game the OST that helps set everything of the atmosphere. The extra content is actually pretty nice. You get music, art gallery and some other things to look forward after clearing the game. It's mostly beginner friendly on terms of figuring out what to do and there are plenty of save slots for you to save every important moment of decision making.On the negative side there is a few chapters that can drag with details that people can pretty much figure out themselves while playing. (Nothing wrong with details but sometimes it can be a bit too much), there are some important events that you'll wish could had some CGs and some cases more sprites for more expressions. (This might be mostly me complaining over my adoration of the artstyle)Overall and probably expected by now I recommend the game for anyone looking to play a pretty darn good visual novel.+Amazing Art Direction and Atmosphere+Outstanding OST+Great CGs+Really Good Story+Interesting Endings + Dead Ends+Characters are pretty fleshed out and play the role they should therefore getting your like or dislike of them.+Nice Extras- Some pretty cliche writing on parts of the starting chapters which mostly was intentional for future parts of the story but still doesn't change that it was expected..- Could have more sprites and CGs for some events that seemed pretty important.- Pacing issues (It can drag a bit too much on a few chapters)",positive
The House in Fata Morgana,"If you like Visual Novels, you owe it to yourself to play this.The House in Fata Morgana is a grand tale about many things: faith, finding your own place in the world, interpersonal relationships and, most of all, love.In a cursed house somewhere in time, You arrive without your memories. A Maid calling you Master then guides you through the mansion's history in a bid to have you remember everything yourself.Can you face the truth, not matter how much misery and sadness it may bring?It's been quite a while since a story was able to make me weep like this. While it can be indeed sad, almost unbearably so at times, there is meaning in all the sadness. And once all is said and done, the feeling of catharsis, of heartwarming happiness is absolutely worth it. The characters go through hell and back, and they come out stronger for it.Not to mention how one of the stronger themes in Fata Morgana is that things aren't as they appear at first. Characters are introduced in one particular light, only to become completely different people with many circumstances and reasons for being the way they are, to the point where we can trully sympathize with them despite whatever attrocities they might commit.This attests to the quality not only of the writing, but of the localization team as well. The translation is top-notch and everything reads nicely and properly adapted to the eras this story portrays. The characters feel like real people with their own distinctive voices and personalities.The production values are also nothing to scoff at, even more so considering this was actually done by a doujin (lit. indie) circle. I mean, damn. The art is incredibly awesome, extremelly pretty and beautiful to look at, be it endearing or violent moments. The music is orgasmically beautiful as well, with MANY tracks having vocals and sung in many different languages, even Portuguese (being a Brazillian, it is kinda hard to understand and, when you look at the lyrics, you see they didn't fully grasp the language though).My only gripes with it would be that some scenes here and there (mostly in the final arc) do drag a little bit on points that were already estabilished, and the presence of timed choices. While it made absolute sense within the context to have them so, in the end it's just sort of annoying for you to get an ending simply because you didn't click on your answer quick enough. Also, the CG gallery and music player only unlock after you reach the true ending as far as I could tell, and this could take around 30 hoours.Also, speaking of choices, this VN does things a bit differently: the begginning is actually linear and choices gradually appear towards the end, but for completely justified reasons.At the end of the day, The House in Fata Morgana is a masterpiece in it's own right, and the fact that this game seems to be so obscure and with so few reviews is almost criminal if you ask me. This deserves to be recognized at least by the general VN fandom as the masterpiece it is.I'll be looking forward to whatever Novectacle cooks up next and will gladly purchase it full-price.",positive

The House in Fata Morgana,"Product received for free(An online acquaintance has gifted me this game.)NOTE: There's a content warning listhere if you have psychological sensitivities (SPOILERS!).[blog.mangagamer.org]There's adownloadable demo[blog.mangagamer.org]as well.Copy-pasted from a r/visualnovels thread I made:Fata Morgana is one of those works of art that roll around every other year, one of the master works of the genre, one of those immaculately done paintings that are never hanged on a wall befitting their excellence and beauty. It's a testament to many things as a visual novel: It shows us how a VN does not need the slightest inkling of Japanese culture in it to be a masterpiece of the genre; how the art, music and prose can mesh together to form a magnificent crescendo of literary beauty, how one can craft a story so poignant that every single person -from the happiest to the most sorrowful- can relate to it in some manner; most importantly of all, how one can prevail over unrelenting abuse and torment.PremiseFata Morgana begins as you, ???, wake up inside a run-down, gloomy mansion that feels as desolate and dead as the Maid who greets you upon your awakening. She calls you ""Master"". In order to reawaken your memories, she decides to show you around various rooms in the mansion. Every room leads to a different era, a different cast, a different tale...StoryFata Morgana is a master stroke in terms of narrative design. Every single member of the cast has believable motivations and they are presented as complex characters; breathing, living people both in their cruelty and compassion. The pacing is virtually airtight save for a few possible stretches that last less than an hour, and I personally welcomed them for giving me a rest and time to wind down from the rest of the experience. It's a tragic tale, but a tale that harbors hope, and a tale that takes its (heavy, grotesque, tormentful) subject matter seriously. By the time the utterly cathartic ending rolls out, you have an experience on your hands that could very well keep you thinking on it for life. The prose is quite well-written (It's no Planescape: Torment, but it is easily an above average translation), and many variations of dialogue and scene depictions, internal monologues are all written in a manner that is not pretentious or overly complicated.ArtFata Morgana's most distinctive feature at first glance is its art style. The sprite work is meticulously detailed and somewhat realistic while still retaining some artistic flair. All characters are drawn expressively while the backgrounds are filtered photos that appear as abstract CGs- which might ring alarm bells for those who loathed Higurashi and Umineko's original backgrounds, but the truth of the matter is that -at least for me- the backgrounds in this game resemble oil paintings, reflecting a distant but not yet fully forgotten past. The only significant flaw of the (2012) game- and perhaps the whole VN- is that it is in 4:3. The art is in beautiful tandem with the music as well, which brings me to my next point...SoundtrackFata Morgana's soundtrack could have single-handedly let this VN be a GOTY contender. As it stands, it is still potentially the best aspect of Fata Morgana and that is not light praise. It has the best soundtrack I have heard in any videogame or VN, bar none (yes, that includes Umineko :P). Fata Morgana's tracks range from wistful to catchy to ominous and hectic to peaceful and they are quite varied for each era you visit. Especially songs with vocals are incredibly touching and quite a few of them have stayed with me since (to the point where their emotional baggage makes it difficult to listen to them). Giselle and Hex in particular are godlike, though I'd recommend you to not listen to those two before fully experiencing the VN. The OST is mostly comprised of sad tracks (melancholic, wistful and distressed) but that makes the stellar peaceful and happy tracks stand out all the more. The music's effect is amplified unimaginably when you hear them in the VN- as I said before, the art and music in Fata Morgana are in beautiful, priceless harmony with each other.MiscellaneousMenus: The game's menus are decent, with a few options for text speed and separate settings for BGM and SFX. By saving at choices and particular spots in the story, I almost ran out of save slots. But the number there should be fine if you do not mind overwriting here and there.Choices-There are a fair number of choices in the game, but they're all really straightforward so unless you want to go for 100% completion, you really don't need a walkthrough.Extras-After the completion of the game, you unlock galleries for art and music as well as a lengthy, non-canon ""backstage"" scene that's pretty funny. The vocal tracks have illustrations you can view that display the original and English lyrics for each song, and they look great! The game's DRM-free OST is available through Steam as well, as DLC. Definitely worth it.ConclusionFata Morgana is a classic. Its art, music and its masterful execution of its subject matter cannot be found anywhere else in the medium. Fata Morgana strains the definitions of what a VN can be and can accomplish, and it needs to be tried just for that.",positive
The House in Fata Morgana,"Beware: This game contains mature content, such as gore, torture, blood, prostitute and rape.The House in Fata Morgana is a mystery and horror Visual Novel, published by MangaGamer and developed by Novectacle.One day, you wake up in an old mansion without any memories at all. In front of you, there is a maid telling you to follow her. You take her hand and follow her through different doors, different tragedies. As the story goes on, while witnessing each tragedy, youâre free to end your story. Or to go onâ¦But there are those who would sayâYou were able to bear them because they werenât your tragedies.âThe House in Fata Morgana really was a pleasent surprise for me. I never thought it would stuck with me that much. I didnât know what to expect, as I went through it without any background information about it at all. The characters really grew on me and I also shared a few tears while reading this Visual Novel. To be honest, I only bought this game because I thought the artwork looked very pretty. Turns out it was the best choice I ever made. The House in Fata Morgana is one of my absolute favorite games and I would give anything to read it for the first time again.Though, The House in Fata Morgana starts quite slow, itâs really worth it to go on. If youâre looking for youâre typical horror game, Iâm afraid youâre wrong here. This game doesnât contain any jump scares at all. Instead, it gives a creepy vibe and youâll get goosebumps just from reading this novel.Given this, the atmosphere is very dark and depressing, yet there is so much character development and even funny moments. I ended up finding myself smirking, laughing and crying. The House in Fata Morgana was such a rollercoaster for me.While slowly finding out more about each character, I absolutely couldnât predict the story. Itâs very mysterious in the beginning and you just get thrown into the story without any information. And believe me, I couldnât stop playing until the mysteries got revealed. Each time I thought I know what was happening, I got disappointed quite fast. Not everything is as it seems at first sight, especially in this game.As already mentioned, character development really is an important part of this game. Youâll meet a lot of characters in The House of Fata Morgana and will definitely like some immediately, while you will desprite others. I ended up getting quite surprised at some actions of some characters. Whom can you even still trust?The House in Fata Morgana is very linear. There are choices while playing the game, though there is only one true ending. The bad endings are quite short and really unsatisfying, especially the ones in the beginning. The game ends before the real plot even started. If you end your story after witnessing the tragedies, I wouldnât say the story isnât completed. It is kinda completed in some way, though youâll miss a lot of the story, as everything will get revealed slowly.Also, I have to praise the wonderful soundtrack. Some were creepy, jumpy and some just peaceful. I really liked the instrumental songs, it matched to the Novel and its theme. Itâd be nice if The House in Fata Morgana had Voice Acting, though itâs definitely not a deal breaker for me.All in all, Iâd recommend The House in Fata Morgana to anyone who is into a good mystery story with a lot of character development. Even if youâre just looking for a nice way to spend a few evenings or want to get hooked up by a Visual Novel. This game is really detailed and the artwork is gorgeous.ðððð¥ ðð«ðð ð­ð¨ ðð¨ð¥ð¥ð¨ð° ð¦ð²ðð®ð«ðð­ð¨ð« ððð ððð¨ð« ð¦ð¨ð«ð ððð¯ð¢ðð°ð¬!",positive

The House in Fata Morgana,"Only one word could describe The House in Fata Morgana â MASTERPIECE. This is the best visual novel Iâve ever had the pleasure of playing.Donât let the cover art fool you, this game is A LOT more than what it appears to be. Itâs very hard to talk about why I love Fata Morgana so much without delving into spoilers, but Iâll try my best. And trust me, this is a game where you want to avoid spoilers at all costs.According to the writer, âThey did not specifically target men or women with the game, and instead just intended to make a game for players who enjoy storiesâ. And they accomplished just that. This was an incredibly well-crafted story. The tales were gripping & addictive. The romance was wonderfully moving. The tragedies were utterly heart-breaking. I cried my eyes out at some points. At other points, my jaw hit the ground in shock. Other times, I smiled hoping the very best for these characters that had grasped my heart. The characters in this game are so painfully human and real - they make human mistakes, have real weaknesses... but there's still hope. And Fata Morgana displays that wonderfully.Both the art and music are hauntingly beautiful. A couple of the songs brought tears to my eyes, while others had my heart racing in anticipation in accordance with their scenes. Such an amazing job all around.Of course, it may not be everyoneâs cup of tea (originally didnât think itâd be mine, but well it ended up being my favourite tea flavor â bad pun, letâs move on *ahem*). A lot of themes in Fata Morgana are not present in other VNs that Iâve read, and by pushing boundaries, the writer presents a remarkably unique experience.I implore everyone to give this game its much needed second glance & give this underrated gem a chance. Youâll be in for one heck of a ride.(I had posted this review on my blog, but this was the short & sweet version for steam)",positive
The House in Fata Morgana,"Wow. This game as a masterpiece. I couldn't help but revere the beauty of the plot, the lore, the character design, the way how each character is flawed and human, the plot twists thrown your way, and the ending that managed to wrap up everything together.Hands down the best visual novel game I ever played. I am afraid that this has set my bar too high, and that I will keep comparing the future games I play to this one. I am looking forward to replaying this and immersing myself once more in the beautiful tragedy in The House in Fata Morgana.",positive

The House in Fata Morgana,"The House in Fata Morgana is a game I heard a lot about online. It was a VN praised by everyone who'd played it as a hidden gem and recommended for people even if they didn't care for visual novels. Not going to lie I was a little hesitant going in at first, I haven't played many visual novels (unless you count the social parts of persona) and it seemed not many people had really been playing it on steam, but irregardless of my hesitation I jumped in.This game is worth the try. No doubt.It may just be one of the best stories I've seen in any medium. Period. The way the story evolves into ways you don't expect is captivating. The music, while perhaps strange at first, gives a very immersive feel while you are reading it and some tracks are just outstanding (my favorite track I would list but the name may be considered a spoiler, if you've played the game you probably know what track i'm talking about). Give this visual novel a go if you love good stories, writing, and characters and if you end up loving the game go and support the people that brought it over here by picking up the companion visual novel ""the House in Fata Morgana: requiem for innocence (only play it after beating this game unless you like spoilers), had a blast going through this emotional masterpiece and can't wait to play through the requiem for innocence.",positive

The House in Fata Morgana,"This game... Is in no doubt a masterpiece,from the music to the writing ,it all is stellar. It didn't make me cry but I definitely felt pain seeing the characters I grew so attached to through their journeys ,it also is a very touching story, it has helped me understand someone I once knew... And wish I acted differently more than I already do, this is a story that will stay with you forever, I am glad to have bought it along with its prequel who you should NOT play first.",positive
The House in Fata Morgana,"Let me start by saying that I'm not a visual novel enjoyer. However, I decided to play this to completion due to the overwhelmingly positive rating I saw for it. The story is interesting and griping, however I will say that this game could've cut some of the fat.  It's a little on the verbose side with details that I found to be irrelevant. It's very long, there's very little gameplay, and honestly very little art in general.So why am I giving this a recommendation? I think the soundtrack is memorable for the most part and the story kept me guessing the entire time. If you basically want to read a book, you could do worse. I thought about the story a lot after finishing the game and if something can sit with me like that, it has to be pretty good.",positive
The House in Fata Morgana,"I'm going to keep this review short and on point, as others will probably cover things in more detail.---I have played so many different kinds of games over the years, spanning varying genres  on so many different consoles and systems. In the last year, I've gotten into reading Visual Novels, as I have always had a love for adventure games and I just so happen to love reading. I've read through most of the top rated ones, such as Umineko and G-String no Senjou.Let's ignore that and get back to the 'game'.Hopelessness and tragedy are a device used so often, and yet they don't usually resonate with your soul on a deep level. This is the main theme in this 'game'.I don't really want to admit this, but as a grown man, I was bawling... often.Once I began, I couldn't stop reading this piece. The soundtrack, the characters, the art, the story. Everything was entwined so thoroughly that it left its mark on me when I was done. It was enthralling, and it was beautiful.I would argue this is one of the greatest love stories ever told. Perhaps you don't really see value in reading a book on a computer. I would recommend you reconsider.",positive
The House in Fata Morgana,"Possibly the finest story, or piece of fiction for that matter I've ever consumed. I'm surprised I'm saying this because of my lack of experience with playing visual novels I didn't expect to find such a gem so quickly (or at all) I find it baffling that this story was able to extract such emotion from me, there are only a few pieces of fiction that have left me sobbing in the end, this is one of them. The sound track for this game is also breath taking, truly legendary and one of the best I've heard. I think anyone who's a fan of visual novels and can stand a slower pacing at times will find It life changing. The slow-burn story left me thinking about past encounters in my life, and the unjustified anger I've had towards others at times over minute things. The House in Fata Morgana is a story of love, loss, hurt, recovery, understanding and forgiveness. This game will leave you wrecked for awhile. Without doubt a masterpiece.""But I've learned something in my years... ""reality"" exists from more than one perspective."" -Michel",positive
The House in Fata Morgana,"Humans have a far greater capability to hurt, betray, and forsake others than they do to love, trust, and protect them. And that's precisely what the majority of people do.At first glance,The House in Fata Morganatells tales of not romance, friendship and innocence: it mainly tells tragedies of breakdowns, betrayals and scheming. It ruthlessly delves into the bottom of despair, but it is only to better bring us back up to the realms of hope.As an anti-hero would take the place of a hero,The House in Fata Morganaskillfully casts an anti-romantic story over a ramification of several stories, and it is absolutely worth it.You cantryto remember the past, but it's an absolute, utter waste of time. Erase everything - all your sorrows. Wipe them away for a fistful of happiness. Allow me to show you... that you have no need of the past.The House in Fata Morganahas several settings and tells stories of multiple settings. The adolescence of a young brother and her sister, and the blooms of love and their consequences. A journey through the highway to insanity and hopes of salvation. An ever daunting gap between husband and wife and their own attempts, struggles and misadventures. Unfortunate circumstances clash with a life of isolation.As vague as I'm trying to make them, these tales, in truly stylish gothic aesthetics, are spread across centuries of each other. It does a good job of keeping things moving and ensures variety of events.That was your first time witnessing those tragedies. [...] You were able to bear 'em because they weren'tyourtragedies.The tragedies bear great impact in their appeal to us to empathize and pity the protagonists. They make us despair for them because they make us hope that all will end well. In that, the writing is successfully fulfilling and greatly delivering the feelings behind the stories. The way it builds up to the second half of the VN is absolutely enthralling and really engaging.The House in Fata Morgana, as a visual novel, is quite unconventional. It really is, in the best ways. I must also commend all the work that went into the localization, because practically nothing read or felt as something that came specifically from Japan (well, except for that one guy, but even then he just felt exotic), or Japanese tropes. It's absolutely refreshing, in a medium where so many devices, settings and tropes get used and reused so ubiquitously.At times, I would find the art odd looking, but it's overshadowed by how beautiful, stylish and gorgeous some of the CGs look. Frankly enough, the main reason why some people (myself included) weren't immediately seduced by the art style is because they are not used at all to this style. Overall though, it's great for the eyes, especially to wash away the excess of moe blobs.The OST is unusual and unlike many things in this world. But again, this VN detaches itself well from many things in this world. It can be enchanting, sorrowful or downright bewitching. I'm personally way more used to instrumentals in VNs, so having most of them vocalized is a different experience. There is no voice acting though, but adding on the previous point, I think vocalized OST wouldn't clash well with voice acting.The characters are flawed, but that is the main drive of the novel. How they are flawed though feels deeply human, especially when there's always reasons or motives to how they are acting like they are. Well,almosthuman anyway. At times, they might feel repetitive, but they are mostly coherent and worthy of the stories they took part in.My greatest complain aboutThe House in Fata Morganawill be in its technical implementation. While it is usable, and at times, really well exploited, it feels older than it is, and not in a gothic way. In contrast to everything else about it, the interface doesn't try to do much things differently than in other VNs; in fact, I'd say it does less than average when it comes to immersion (other than by the story itself). Perhaps it is a good thing, as the UI keeps out of the way of the story, leaving us devoted only to it, but I would have liked to have seen more effects for immersion. Perhaps a bit of screen shaking, more animations, subtle SFX... There's definitely room for improvement.Still, all in all,The House in Fata Morganabelongs to the realm of top-tier stories, and I would love to see more visual novels in this style. Or just ones that delves that well into uncommon topics and unexploited settings.",positive
The House in Fata Morgana,"If you like going on an emotional roller coaster ride, then this visual novel is for you.The soundtrack is also marvelous, to be honest I found the first few songs... strange? eerie? creepy? weird? I couldn't quite put a finger on what it is. But it grew on me a lot, and it's now definitely one of the most memorable game OSTs for me.",positive
The House in Fata Morgana,"Writing:The beginning starts out slow, but you know you're reaching the end of the chapter whenever things escalated. Then the subtly in the plot jumps out the window, and if you didn't know what was happening, it would hit you like a truck.Music:Likewise, the music emphasizes this. It suited the VN very well, albeit different.Visuals:The CGs stand out from other VNs. They had a sort of painting aesthetic, and for the most part, pleasant to look at.Overall:The House in Fata Morgana is fairly long (it took me about 36 hours to complete), and has a fairly dark story with likable, relateable characters. The few choices you have to make throughout the game are simple, and make sense. I had no technical issues on my end, but I think the game started out in windowed mode (which was annoying)tldr;I'd rate the game an 8.5 out of 10, but I'm pretty bad at making reviews. So if you like reading suspenseful stories, and don't mind the slow bits, then get the game.tldr;tldr;uglyspeckles",positive
The House in Fata Morgana,"I don't really leave many reviews on games, but after completing this game I cant see why i wouldn't. I initially bought this game a few years back but took a long pause from the game, until recently i finally found the motivation to continue progressing through the story, and God I am so glad that I did.Just this week alone I've spent more than 4 hours each day, just captivated by the emotionally wrenching stories exploring the depths of human despair and the lengths that one might go for the person they love. The OST is phenomenal, complimenting each and every story and character, and the art is equally as remarkable. This game may not be for everyone however, as this entire game is primarily comprised of reading and is filled with incredibly tragic experiences.This is one of the first visual novels that I have read, and I'm not too confident that many will top the House in Fata Morgana. To me, this is certainly one of the greatest and impactful pieces of literature I've read, and you're doing yourself a favor by purchasing this visual novel.I've read a few other reviews, and something that'll stay with me is:""You were able to bear them because they weren't your tragedies.""10/10.",positive
The House in Fata Morgana,"I've been bouncing on and off of visual novels for ages. The focus on fluff, needless exposition and over the top dialogue has always been something that has grated against my patience with the medium. It always just felt like I could pick up a book and always have a better experience and that visual novels were redundant in a world where anime and manga existed. Fata Morgana proved me wrong.In a way I regret having read this visual novel because now I'm afraid that I'll never be able to read anything like it. This is without a doubt one of the most sublime experiences I've had in any form of media. Everything about this visual novel oozes such atmosphere. The music and art complement the story and the feelings of the characters so well. I often found myself sharing the feelings of the characters because the colour palette and the  art style do such an amazing job. Trust me when I say this... it is not often that I find myself crying over tragedies that happen to fictional characters but this game made me shed tears.I kind of wish that I could erase my memories of ever having experienced this just so that I can experience it again for the first time. This visual novel has shown me what the medium is capable of and even though I doubt that I'll ever come across such a divine experience ever again in this medium, I'm now a lot more patient and open to seeing what other stories there are to explore.If you care about experiencing great stories then I highly suggest that you give this a try.",positive

The House in Fata Morgana,"Honestly, the pain exfoliates your soul",positive
The House in Fata Morgana,"Going to be honest here, I was about to refund this visual novel during the 1 hour mark due to how bored I felt during the beginning.  It starts out as a cliche historical romance novel and I found myself disliking the introduced characters to the point I wasnât sure this was for me. I ended up keeping this game sorely for the hope that it gets better, and I couldnât have been more correct.Fata Morgana is a long visual novel with a stronger second half that delves into some seriously dark and complicated topics. I donât want to spoil anything so wonât say much about the story, but just know that this game is incredibly deceptive and youâre getting much more than you see in the trailer and the store page summary. The character art is gorgeous and the background art is unique in how it tends to favor abstractness over realism; half of the times I couldnât tell what the current location was and that ties into the story perfectly. The soundtrack is god-like and helps to sell the tragedies with its orchestral tracks.Overall, I would say if youâre looking to play a game or looking for a visual novel where your choices matter, then donât bother with this title; itâs a linear story and your limited choices have minimal to no impact. However, if you want to immerse yourself in a long and complicated story with great visuals and a killer soundtrack, then this is a must buy",positive
The House in Fata Morgana,"a few years have passed and i've finally mustered up the courage to review this masterpiece.reading this touched me in a way that i don't think will ever be repeated by any other form of media. it's a harrowing ride in more ways than one. the subject matter does get dark but, the way that the issues that each character goes through are handled is artful. it cannot be stressed how beautiful of a story this game turned out to be. i was pleasantly surprised to find myself so immersed and invested in the fate of the cast. the beginning is a little slow and there are triggering things throughout that extra sensitive people may want to avoid.it's best to go in blind and not look up too much info. the twists and turns are worth experiencing without any knowledge of what you're getting into. moyotaro's artwork seems to grow the more you progress and the soundtrack was crafted carefully. every song just adds more to the atmosphere. if you have even a slight interest in reading this then go ahead and dive in. after all is said and done, i've read this and got my heart torn to shredstwice. it was worth every penny and hour silently crying spent.",positive
The House in Fata Morgana,"Had me falling for every twist and turn the game had to offer, with every revelation came another and I couldn't even fathom it. While this game does require a quite an investment in time to complete, I say every moment is worth it. Every little detail is important and no stone is left unturned, making for a satisfying end. Rich, complex characters you can empathize with whether you liked them or not. The amazing soundtrack and sound effects really gave the game an extra ""UPMH"" to it, probably one of it's greatest charms besides it's writing. I have to admit the art wasn't really to my taste at first, but as a I played I realized it's haunting/gothic-esque nature just adds more to the game. I was truely terrified with some the cgs and sprites adding more to the haunting nature of the game. Though I said it was investment in time, I'm sure you'll find yourself done with the game in no time because you just have to keep on reading (a real page turner if it had pages to turn). With every glimmer of hope there is a boatload of despair to follow and that's what Fata Morgana delivers beautifully.",positive
The House in Fata Morgana,"I finished The House in Fata Morgana! As with Certain Other Games you may have seen me play, this is essentially a long book. Maybe you could say that of most visual novels. The clue is in the name. But in particular this is one with very few choices, and none that don't lead to fairly quick dead ends.And as to the story... So when I was young I read a lot of Kurt Vonnegut. When I came to write my own major work at the end of high school, I was inspired by one of his rules for writing short stories: ""Be a sadist. No matter how sweet and innocent your leading characters, make awful things happen to themâin order that the reader may see what they are made of."" I used to think this was a cool and fun thing to do, but I think I've gone off it somewhat lately, and increasingly look for stories with a bit more light. That said, The House in Fata Morgan subscribes heavily to this technique. It just turns the Misery valve to full and then breaks off the tap. Or something. Idk how valves work. Point is, it is structured to havethemost miserable things happen to its characters at all time. And at first, at least for me, there was a feeling of ""oh this feels a little gratuitous."" But it starts to make sense, and it comes together, and we really do get to see what the characters are made of in the most delightful way.In terms of the visual novelly features, the art is quite lovely. The music is incredible, like, really often â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ weird but in ways that utterly grew on me to the extent I bought the soundtrack. And in one particular chapter, it did some really cool and unsettling things the likes of which I've not seen in any other visual novel, in my extraordinarily limited experience.My only critique is one that I would also have about Umineko, These stories arelong. They sometimes feel longer than they need to be, but in both cases I look back at them and think, ""Literally not a single scene could have been cut. This story, so wonderfully told, needed to be this way."" But then maybe it's not a matter of scenes. Maybe some moments could have used a bit less repetition, slightly less wordiness, a slightly tighter framing.Anyway, there's no question of it having overstepped its welcome. In fact I've already got the... Expansion? Follow up? Bonus chapter? I don't know what it is, but I'm about to start it.",positive
The House in Fata Morgana,"The ""House in Fata Morgana"" is the best piece of literature I've read in my life.The game tells a deep and dramatic story, with a lot of mystery to it. Overall, I'd say it has a very dark plot, but by no means it lacks wholesome and loving moments. The overall darkness of the events that unfold emphasize by a great deal the beauty of such moments of calmness, emotional vulnerability and acceptance some characters go through.The novel also has some of the most remarkably human characters I've seen in any piece of fiction. By ""human"" I mean they do not have cartoonishly simple or superficial motivations designed to make them fit a role in the plot or to justify their actions. Personally, by the end of the game, I ended up empathizing and caring about all the characters, even some of those who were objectively immoral and/or evil.Fata Morgana also makes a masterful use of its OST -which is mind-blowing and beautiful in its own right- to set the mood for the different kind of moments in the story. It is very effective at making the delivery of some of the most dramatic moments in the novel completely unforgettable.I would describe the artwork as ""hauntingly beautiful"". I will say, however, that it took me some time to get used to the art style. Initially I did not find it very appealing as I do now (mostly because the other VNs I have played have a typical anime art-style). However, Fata Morgana's choice of art seems perfect for the story they are trying to tell.I give this game a 10/10, if you are reading this, just buy it, tbh.I hope this visual novel one day becomes as famous as it deserves to be.",positive
The House in Fata Morgana,"I was originally made aware of Fata Morgana many years ago when I was asking for VN recommendations similar to Umineko. For some reason it took me a while to go ahead and buy the game and then even longer to actually play it.Now that I finally did I can safely say that yeah, I can certainly see some similarities to Umineko both in terms of plot and characters and also the themes it is trying to convey, but more importantly: it simply is a damn good story that I wish I had read sooner.The store page does a nice job at laying out the basics. You, the unnamed amnesiac protagonist, wake up in an abandoned mansion and are subsequently greeted by the similarly unnamed maid of the house who then proceeds to guide you through multiple doors which will show you the tragedies that occurred at this supposedly cursed location in an attempt to make you remember who you are. These all take place over 100 years apart from each other and feature casts of what seem to be completely unrelated characters, which makes one wonder how these tales could at all be connected to one another... yet there are certain elements that seem to exist in all of them no matter what year the story takes place in even though they realistically couldn't.The mysteries behind these plot connections and your identity are - at least initially - the main hooks that are supposed to keep you engaged in the overarching narrative while you are reading what basically amounts to a collection of short stories.These short stories, for better or for worse, only get better as the story progresses. Meaning if you aren't particularly engaged at the beginning but don't HATE the experience thus far, try giving it another chapter or two and keep in mind that there's probably more to things than meets the eye.I'd love to just gush about the story and ESPECIALLY the characters of Fata Morgana, some of which are genuinely masterfully written and among my favorites of all time across all genres and mediums, but it is pretty impossible to go into detail about anything here without delving into spoiler territory.To describe the whole thing in broad strokes, I would say it is a tale about humanity, identity and trauma. What it means to be yourself, to have a reason to live, to overcome hardships and deal with whatever scars said hardships left behind. This also means that it does not shy away from showing off the ugly sides of humanity most of us are probably familiar with, especially during the times Fata Morgana takes place in.Personally, I don't think the game every veers into exploitation territory with its mature content like many other VNs tend to do. It certainly doesn't pull its punches in terms of the subject matters it chooses to tackle and won't try to hide whatever bad situation is currently playing out in front of you, but doesn't linger on these scenes for longer than necessary either. That doesn't mean that said scenes can't be hard to get through though; if anything they might stick with you even harder than those of some gory shockfest schlock because the goal isn't just to gross you out but instead to make you empathize... with some of the characters anyway. This is obviously highly subjective though, so ymmv. It might also be worth mentioning that the mature content is mostly contained in the writing. There are some images with blood and nudity but nothing too egregious not to also be released on consoles more or less untouched.That being said, I do think that Fata Morgana handles multiple serious topics with more respect than the vast majority of media, no matter their form or place of origin, manages to do. And that is highly commendable.Regarding its presentation, I think it's safe to say that its visuals are what made many people give Fata Morgana a closer look in the first place. The characters and CGs/event images all look amazing, although the backgrounds are admittedly a lot less impressive. Since this is the original version of the game it is also sadly stuck at a 4:3 aspect ratio, so keep that in mind. Another thing that often gets praised is the soundtrack, which is indeed pretty fantastic even if it might take a little while to get used to. I found the vocals to be a tad grating during the first door but quickly grew to appreciate them afterwards. Apropos vocals; there is no voice acting, which kinda makes sense with all the singing that's going on in the background but still - something to keep in mind.There are multiple endings but only one True End in this game, which is really easy to reach without a guide as Bad/Dead Ends generally tend to occur immediately after a choice. Just in case, reserve a saveslot (of which there are a lot of) for each choice and you will be fine.All in all I feel fairly confident in claiming that The House in Fata Morgana is one of my favorite stores of all time - or at least of all the ones I have experienced in my life thus far. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys character-driven stories as long as you don't mind a bit of suffering and have a little patience to handle waiting for all the story threads to come together.TLDRPros+ Very engaging character-driven plot with tons of mysteries to unravel+ Amazing characters with A LOT more depth than initially meets the eye+ Mature handling of complex topics+ Pacing for the most part extremely good+ Great art and soundtrack make for an enchanting atmosphere+ Top-tier writing, devoid of many tropes that usually plague the medium+Extremely cathartic and satisfying conclusionCons- Only in 4:3 resolution- No voice acting in lieu of a vocals-focused soundtrack- Arguably starts off with the weakest part- Short story-style storytelling is not for everyone, despite the developing overarching narrative- Many Bad Ends could be more fleshed out- Might put you in a bad mood while reading",positive
The House in Fata Morgana,"Very good vn. Worth every single cent i spent on it. The story gets better as it progresses. The music and art style is enchantingly beautiful.Like what many said, this vn gets very heavy in the later half, so please only read if you have the mental maturity for it. As this is an all-ages vn, the pictures will be within reason, so don't betooafraid.If you do read this, boy you are in for a treat! Just go in blind, don't read up anything about it to get the best experience. I read a similar advice, went in blind, and thoroughly enjoyed myself.",positive
The House in Fata Morgana,"The House in Fata Morgana, as other reviews have said, is a work of art. Not just the sprites, or the music, or the writing. It is the combination of those three things that brings you to cusp of your emotions. The characters that you come to love, hate, or forgive are forged in front of you. The experience you receive while you play this game is something very few things can give to you. This is a herald of what the Visual novel genre can be; not porn, or a dating simulator. But a visceral experience that is multi-sensory. It allows you to empathize and fall in love with the people, understanding their motivations.This is a story about what it means to be human, what our personal experiences and emotions can drive us to do. It will teach you that there is always a chance at redemtion, you just have to seek it. Remember, never let go of her hand.",positive

The House in Fata Morgana,"This isn't porn. That's an awful way to start discussing art, but we're talking about a Mangagagmer VN, so I felt that was a necessary. Not even borderline porn -- there are a few scenes with PG-13 nudity, but they're the dramatic kind, not the fanservice kind.This story is an exploration of extreme kinds of love, including both the destructive and transcendant kind. It's over-the-top-melodrama like only the japanesse can do it. It's got alot of cliche elements (it wouldn't be a japanese romance if the couple didn't fall on each other and land in a boob-grab), but he overarching story is perfectly fresh.It does start painfully slow, and I hated the music in the first chapter, but it does pick up from there. So if you're feeling buyer's remove watching the painfully cliche interactions between Mell and Nellie to nasty harpsichord music... don't request a refund. It gets better.Storywise, I think it was good, but not great. I've never seen the japanese pull off gothic horror (except for _maybe_ a few items from the 80s). This is no exception, I'm afraid. I think it would've been far improved if the story was presented in a less linear fashion, along the lines of a Chris Nolan movie. I think it would've captured the feeling of confused, fragmented memories much better than this systematic presentation.It's low budget -- no voice acting and several significant characters with no illustrations -- but the artistic style is great. You can see the illustrations, but the music is just as good (except for the stuff from the first chapter, which had 100% too much harpsichord.)I'd still recommend waiting to try to get it on sale, and only if you're sure it's the kind of thing you like. Japanese melodrama isn't for everyone, but if you like that kind of thing, i think you'll love this.",positive
The House in Fata Morgana,"Hoo boy. This is very, very, VERY niche product. With its new sale price, and newfound fame (and infamy), it's going to find its way in front of a lot of new eyeballs.For the overwhelming majority of those folks--this is not going to appeal to you. For a brief description, imagine the novel ""Turn of the Screw"" combined with a soap operas that ran for decades--""Guiding Light,"" or ""The Young and the Restless."" The novel is a short one, but those television series ran for 40 or 50 years each, and this game feels like every one of those years in sequence.The art is intriguing. It's not-quite-manga. It's sort of...interesting, but also off-putting. It's a little too detailed for the Japanese style, a little too cartoony for traditional Western painting. It's different, anyway, so some will enjoy that. The sound design is excellent, effects, timing, and use of stereo. I found the music too heavy on singing (in Japanese) which got very noodly to the point of abrasive. Considering the amount of time it takes spent inside the story, those headphones will start to feel claustrophobic.The whole product together is very bombastic. The beginning is nigh-intolerable; florid, lurid, inartful prose, resembling YA fiction for the Hot Topic set, clutching a thesaurus in one hand and an ankh in the other. It settles down after 10 minutes or so and settles into a more tolerable rhythm.From there, 10-20 minutes in, you figure out if you can live with this experience or not. I decided not. The story is both incredibly drawn-out and incredibly all-over-the-place. It's novel, but near gibberish, and presented in a heavy soap opera, almost live stage, theater, fashion. It's described as ""suspense,"" but that tone is hard to achieve through pock-pock-pock lengthy dialogue. If you enjoy it, it's immersive. If not, irritating, endless jabber. To enjoy it, you've got to enjoy spending a lot, a LOT, of time listening to a lot of flavor (or filler) from these characters. Whether you like it or not, there is no denying that it is incredibly repetitious.Overall, I am just not sure this was the proper venue and format for this kind of story. A lot of people are going to be led to believe this is like other visual novels adapted for computer, and that it's heavier on the suspense/horror than it is. They aren't going to encounter a welcome deviation from expectation, like in Doki Doki Literature Club. Instead they'll either start fast-forwarding, jaw-dropped at the sheer bulk of it, and/or probably feel a little misled, like with Gone Home.I can see how the people who like this, really really like it. It's a strange, compelling, unique animal. But as I said up front, it's going to sell, sometimes accidentally, to a lot more people than end up enjoying it, and also like Gone Home, I can see this one evoking a lot of negative feelings about it too. I'm impressed by the effort, but I don't like it.",negative
The House in Fata Morgana,"The best story i have ever read. The Gothic settings and atmosphere the game gives is amazing, characters are really well written they feel like humans and they are so detailed. The story writing is beyond a masterpiece the amount of foreshadowing and unexpected plot twists are one of the best i have ever come across. 10/10 would 100% recommend playing this masterpiece of storytelling and character development",positive
The House in Fata Morgana,"A unique take on gothic horror, mystery, and suspense The House in Fata Morgana is a full length visual novel taking place in one mansion across three different time periods. Each time period lies behind a door containing a story where nothing is as it seems, and both happiness and hope are fleeting. Never before have I read a visual novel that moved me so much and stuck with me so intensly as The House in Fata Morgana has. Fans for subtle horror and stories that evolve, taking a new light to previous information will absolutely love this visual novel and all it has to offer.You wake up in a dark, abandoned mansion and are approached by a Maid, who requests you take her hand and remember who you are and why you're there. Door by door you explore the mansion, seeing what stories from the past occupants lie in the various rooms spanning hundreds of years. Learn their stories, and see what their pasts reveal about yourself. Nothing is as it appears to be at face value, and what seems harmless can easily turn deadly. In the end it's on you to remember who you are, and why you're trapped in the mansion with these cursed memories - if they're even yours.From a writing standpoint, The House in Fata Morgana is phenomenal. Each and every character has layers of depth to them, a lot of character development in multiple different chapters and multiple different ways. By the end of the novel's true ending there is not a single main or secondary character who's entire character is not made clear - be it their motivations, personality, themes, or their development as a whole. There wasn't a single moment in reading where I felt bored, or like dialog had no place where it was at. Each scene and every line of reading has a purpose, even if it's not made clear right away. A lot of what makes this novel so good is that everything is kept obscure from the reader until you're finally toward the end. You can feel when the last piece fits into place, and suddenly everything from the very beginning makes perfect sense.Hands down The House in Fata Morgana is the best visual novel I have ever read on Steam or otherwise, and certainly in my top picks for best reading material of any kind I have ever experienced. This is a story with such an immersive and detailed plotline, it would be hard to say it's not a work of art. When I say this visual novel evolves, it does so in many layers and from many different perspectives. Characters you would never expect do things you would never see coming. Recurring themes hint at what is to come, but only in a way you would understand upon reading through the novel again. Nothing in terms of hints are given to you, and at almost every point in the novel there are more twists you don't see coming. I would without a doubt say that if The House in Fata Morgana were made into a movie, a tv show or even an anime, I would still love every minute of it. No words can describe how highly I praise this visual novel for every aspect of what it has to offer.If you're looking for ""horror"" in the sense of the word most people think of, The House in Fata Morgana doesn't offer just that. Instead, reading through most of the novel carries a sense of dread that stays with you all the way toward the final chapters, when everything comes into the light and the conflict resolution part of the story has started. There's no real jumpscares, nothing to induce startling fear. However, there's a heavy load of emotional pain, sacrifice, dread, suffering, and plenty of dark and depressing story. Anything that seems happy or joyful is just a mask for all the dark and painful suffering the characters experience. Don't let this novel fool you at any point, pain, sacrifice and suffering are the central themes to this story. There is love and romance to be had, but only if you can make it through the darkness.Most of the gameplay is reading, as is typical with visual novels. There are some choices to be made, some having no impact on the story and others leading you to an ending. Wrong choices instantly give you an ending or a dead end of some sort, though the wrong choices are very obvious if you've been reading the story and understanding what's going on. It is worth mentioning, at each choice it auto saves making it easy to collect the endings for achievements as you go, should you decide to do it that way. If you prefer to come back later, saving often saves you a lot of time skipping text, as this is a very long novel to skip through.Both the music and the art work of The House in Fata Morgana are very unique and detailed. All of the character sprites are very realistic and expressive, standing out from the backdrops but also fitting right in with them. The CG art is both grim and vibrant, providing the perfect visuals to the perfect gothic horror. The music especially is gorgeous to listen to (the entire album is on Spotify, for those interested), each track being made specifically for this visual novel. Most of the music is piano-based, with some lyrics in various languages that sound to me almost like French or Italian. A big testament to how beautiful the soundtrack is, there is all-the-music-in-one condensed orchestral version of the music in this novel on Spotify, as well as a live orchestral show that was put on in Japan. The music, the art, and the story all combine well together, each providing the perfect touches to an amazing gothic novel.If everything I've said so far has not given you a reason to believe that The House in Fata Morgana is worth reading, there's not much else to be said that will. I will forever hold The House in Fata Morgana in the highest praises I have to give. If the game's teaser material, images, description or this review interest you in even the smallest amount, give this novel a read. It's worth every hour of story it has in it, and makes for a breathtaking experience for fans of gothic horror or horror in general.",positive

It tells a huge story in 30 hours with some of the most touching moments I've seen in a VN. It has great characters and romance and deals with topics like SA in a way I haven't really seen in a visual novel.

The House in Fata Morgana,"Definitely the best visual novel I've read.Fata Morgana is a gothic suspense story and I'll not say much more than that, since the storytelling is best experienced blind. Hell, I'd suggest not even looking at the store page or reading the game description at all since it gives some of the plot away. If you are the slightest bit interested in vn's just buy it now and look forward to reading it.I usually can't get into vn's that don't have some type of gameplay element, mainly due to a mix of the writing not being good enough to stand on it's own and my aversion to high school settings, wish fulfillment scenarios, bland lead characters, dating game stuff, etc that make up 90 percent or more of the genre.The soundtrack is great and very different, though a bit overwhelming at times. The game frequently uses tracks that feature vocals and it can take a while to get used to reading text while hearing vocals. It's definitely worth it since the soundtrack is top-notch and adds a ton to the experience.The art is a mixed bag. Character design is quite impressive, though some have some weird sprites, like various characters' ""shouting"" model. Background are a different matter. They look like real-life pictures with an ugly filter applied to them. They're very basic and and stand out as the game's weak link.In short, Fata Morgana is a visual novel that's great for people that don't like the basic stereotypes associated with the genre. Great writing, excellent translation, awesome soundtrack and solid art make it a must read for anyone that's interested in linear video game storytelling.",positive
The House in Fata Morgana,"Wow.  Just finished a complete playthrough and I was pretty much captivated the entire time...and while working or doing other things outside of gaming, I always really looked-forward to returning to this title!That being said, I guess I can be a bit...finnicky.  And while I disagree with the 'non-recommendations' on this page, I also don't 100% agree with the complete love for this game.  It's DEFINITELY awesome, and I DEFINITELY recommend it, but I'm going to do a pro/con list that I hope addresses both the strengths of this game, and why it might annoy you, if you're looking to buy.Pros:+The plot -- There's no beans about it, this game is loooooong.  But the plot is thoroughly-engaging.  It's creepy with layers of mystery that keep you playing, and with a nice (if mellow-dramatic) romantic plot that is really very touching (and, I will be honest, as someone who DOES NOT cry easily...I did, actually, do so at one point in this game).  The characters are all interesting and sympathetic and while there are some predictable tropes, I don't think that that ever undermines the plot...further, although many of the 'holy crap!' moments I did see coming, there were one or two that really took me off guard (door number two in particular) that made it a really engaging and interesting experience.+Music -- The music in this game is extremely atmospheric and very beautiful.  I don't often shell out for a game's soundtrack, but in this case I definitely will be...the composers have a lot to be proud of here.Neutral+/-The visuals -- I debated where to put this, but finally decided on a neutral position.  The visuals are wonderful, the stock-images around the mansion, while repetitive, never FEEL repetitive, as colour is constantly used to augment the mood of the game and it really helps creating a creepy, isolated, and hopeless atmosphere.  Further, the character sprites are well-drawn, each really suiting the character they represent.  IMO this should be looked to by visual novel writers to see how to use the visuals to your advantage in this medium.HOWEVER, one of the major reasons why I didn't put this 100% in the pros, is that it really does feel at times like they didn't quite finish with the art for the game.  There are certain characters who have no sprites what-so-ever, and certain key moments that didn't have art produced for it (Michel's mother visiting him on the cross seemed to be a particular moment that called for one, imo).  Although this wasn't a dealbreaker, it did take away from the experience to a degree.+/-History? -- Another neutral might come off as me nitpicking, but I've got to include it.  The dialogue is (for the most part) quite good and really endears the player to the characters, and the game's settings are fascinating, clearly inspired by genuine periods in European/North American history.But I would say that you have to leave it there...the game is INSPIRED BY these time periods, and (as an historian myself) I can say that both the settings and the dialogue do fall very short of being accurate, with the dialogue being peppered with modern vernacular.  TBH this never bothered me as I was so engaged with the storyworld and characters, but I know this might annoy people, so just in case, I've included it.Cons:-Length -- This is really my only con.  Not that I dislike that the game is so long per-se, but rather, it feels like they needed a really good editor to come in and do a proper edit to cull back some of the narrative and dialogue.  Of course, as the story deals with similar events through multiple perspectives there is going to be an element of repetition, but even when events were new, there were times when I would literally just have the game on auto while I was cleaning the house...I really didn't have to pay a super amount of attention a lot of the time.  And considering how brilliant the mood, plot, characters, and music are, this is kind of a shame, because when I DID just sit and play it was a little tedious at times.  This is definitely NOT a deal breaker imo, but perhaps some feedback for another version, or a warning if you have little patience.Overall, however, a fantastic visual novel that I definitely recommend.  Further...I would love to see more about Morgana herself...I know her story is really covered here, but I found her very interesting and would love to see more.",positive
The House in Fata Morgana,"The House in Fata Morgana has been released for six years yet it is still one of the less known visual novel in our community --- this is not particular surprising as doujin games rarely become popular. Such a shame it is, for this game turns out to be one of the more outstanding if not one of the most outstanding VN out there. A hidden pearl indeed.One thing that makes The House in Fata Morgana unique is its distinguished music pieces. There are around sixty-five tracks in this game and dozens of them with vocal, which isn't the case for vast majority of the VN, and more so these pieces are appetizing while perfectly coherent for their respective scenes and timeframes.Just as the ethereal art style they made these characters out of, the characters imbues elegant beauty to this fairy tale, This is a story of love and betrayal with both happiness and the dismal, constantly stirring rousing emotions of the players. Despite the psychological horror tag this game has, it isn't filled with creepy scenes like in Umineko, but rather poignant tragedies, however as much as I want to elaborate on that, it is unrealistic to establish my points without spoiling the game, which I highly suggest to avoid before reading this VN, therefore I shall not describe the story in details, instead I encourage everyone who has even the mildest interest in VN to see this alluring mirage for themselves.",positive

The way it made me feel is really quite difficult to put into words, but it is like nothing I have ever played before.

The House in Fata Morgana,"Product refundedIf you don't mind playing an inferior version of a fantastic visual novel with less content, then disregard this review and refer to the many other deservedly positive reviews. I would highly recommend getting the Dreams of the Revenants version on Switch, PS4 or Vita.The VN itself is marvellous, it's literally the best I've ever read. But I cannot in good conscience recommend an edition of the game that is so inferior to another one that is readily available.I'd only completed Chapter One on this version and was completely captivated with the story. So much that I went to see if its developer, Novectacle, had a website or catalogue of other games. I found their Twitter which stated that there's a much better version on Switch, PS4 and Vita called the Dreams of the Revenants.The Dreams of the Revenants version has:- Much better, crisper, redone, HD visuals in widescreen- Much better music quality which does the amazing soundtrack justice- The base game and its prequel which are available on Steam- A lot of side stories to provide more background- A new voiced episode Reincarnation- The option to rewind in-game which is very convenientWhat's more is, Novectacle have stated that there's no (current) plans to port the Dreams of the Revenants version to PC, due to licensing or ownership issues. They may update the base game and prequel with the better visuals and sound from the DOTR version, but the extra content will remain exclusive for at the very least, a while.I do not blame Novectacle; they are a very small company. However, I loathe having an inferior version of a game so I immediately applied for a refund on Steam and purchased DOTR on Switch instead and have no regrets.It does also irritate me that the PC version supplied the money for a better version that won't appear on its original platform which facilitated its existence in the first place... but I digress. This happens often with Japanese games and I should've done my research better.I've edited this review recently because I still get comments on it five years later (mostly unhinged) to address that it's since been added to Switch digitally in PAL regions, so just get it on the eShop and enjoy an amazing experience.Also apparently there's a mod that brings DOTR stuff to the PC version on the Fata Morgana Discord. I don't use Discord as I don't have an affinity for grooming children and I don't think the average consumer should have to mod a game to access content that is available on every other platform.",negative
The House in Fata Morgana,"The House in Fata Morgana is way, way, way too long.Essentially the game is 4 stories set in and around a haunted house over different historical eras. Three of those stories are told in the first few hours of the game, and once you've played through those, you've basically seen everything the game has to offer. The fourth story is about how the protagonist came to be in the house and delves into the nature of the curse.The problem with the pacing is after you know all four stories, the game just repeats them again, and again, and then - just when you think it's done - you have to go through it all again. The trick is that each time you get to see it from the eyes of a different character, and supposedly that gives you a deeper insight into their horrific behavior (torture, rape, murder etc). In reality it's just boring, because already in the very first story you learn the ""moral"": every person who does awful things has some â¥â¥â¥â¥ in their past that pushed them to behave that way.It is so trite. If this game was 4 hours long, it might've been a decent VN. Even with the florid and overworked prose, even with the stereotyped characters (women are either submissive or scheming, men are either violent or brooding), the music and art is fantastic and well worth the money. But spending another 10+ hours after the core story was already told getting hit over the head again and again with the same message really ruins anything it had going for it.",negative
The House in Fata Morgana,"Hoo boy. This is very, very, VERY niche product. With its new sale price, and newfound fame (and infamy), it's going to find its way in front of a lot of new eyeballs.For the overwhelming majority of those folks--this is not going to appeal to you. For a brief description, imagine the novel ""Turn of the Screw"" combined with a soap operas that ran for decades--""Guiding Light,"" or ""The Young and the Restless."" The novel is a short one, but those television series ran for 40 or 50 years each, and this game feels like every one of those years in sequence.The art is intriguing. It's not-quite-manga. It's sort of...interesting, but also off-putting. It's a little too detailed for the Japanese style, a little too cartoony for traditional Western painting. It's different, anyway, so some will enjoy that. The sound design is excellent, effects, timing, and use of stereo. I found the music too heavy on singing (in Japanese) which got very noodly to the point of abrasive. Considering the amount of time it takes spent inside the story, those headphones will start to feel claustrophobic.The whole product together is very bombastic. The beginning is nigh-intolerable; florid, lurid, inartful prose, resembling YA fiction for the Hot Topic set, clutching a thesaurus in one hand and an ankh in the other. It settles down after 10 minutes or so and settles into a more tolerable rhythm.From there, 10-20 minutes in, you figure out if you can live with this experience or not. I decided not. The story is both incredibly drawn-out and incredibly all-over-the-place. It's novel, but near gibberish, and presented in a heavy soap opera, almost live stage, theater, fashion. It's described as ""suspense,"" but that tone is hard to achieve through pock-pock-pock lengthy dialogue. If you enjoy it, it's immersive. If not, irritating, endless jabber. To enjoy it, you've got to enjoy spending a lot, a LOT, of time listening to a lot of flavor (or filler) from these characters. Whether you like it or not, there is no denying that it is incredibly repetitious.Overall, I am just not sure this was the proper venue and format for this kind of story. A lot of people are going to be led to believe this is like other visual novels adapted for computer, and that it's heavier on the suspense/horror than it is. They aren't going to encounter a welcome deviation from expectation, like in Doki Doki Literature Club. Instead they'll either start fast-forwarding, jaw-dropped at the sheer bulk of it, and/or probably feel a little misled, like with Gone Home.I can see how the people who like this, really really like it. It's a strange, compelling, unique animal. But as I said up front, it's going to sell, sometimes accidentally, to a lot more people than end up enjoying it, and also like Gone Home, I can see this one evoking a lot of negative feelings about it too. I'm impressed by the effort, but I don't like it.",negative
The House in Fata Morgana,"Seems like I'm in the minority of people who didn't like this VN. I really liked the beginning - it had a dark atmosphere and raised a lot of questions that made me ask myself ""What is this place? Who is the main character? Who is this maid?"".But after the first two chapters (a small portion of the game) I started getting annoyed. The writing is extremely verbose, with uninteresting conversations taking much longer than they could. For some reason when one side in a conversation doesn't say anything, the character's dialogue would often just say ""(...)"" which you need to click through to continue. At several points in the story I started wondering why I'm reading something that feels like it belongs in a rom-com rather than a mystery or a darker work.The resolution to most mysteries and arcs felt extremely unsatisfying. I more or less guessed how the first chapter ends after reading it for a couple minutes (though I kept hoping the VN wouldn't go that route). The second chapter was also predictable, but included an unforeshadowed twist that would make it more tragic.The game's approach to revealing important characters' backstory are info dumps - you won't get them piece by piece with an opportunity to fit the pieces together yourself in the meantime. No - you'll sit down and listen to the characters as they tell you their history from birth til' now.And the sad thing is that this continues until the end of the VN, until all mysteries are resolved and there is nothing else to see. It doesn't help that some of the main characters feel bland and lacking any sort of personality (maybe aside from being ""nice"" / yasashii)On the plus side, the music is quite good. ""Hex"" is really beautiful. ""Ciao carina"" made me stop for a while and just vibe to the tune.",negative
The House in Fata Morgana,"I was offline when I played this, so ignore my playtime.Found this novel to be really, really overrated.No idea why it gets so much praise, it's frankly in the bottom half of VNs I've played. I'm not a fan of mostly-kinetic VNs like this one either, I like to have more choices and more branching plotlines and such.The story is way longer than it needs to be, and all the ""twists"" and ""morals"" are so... banal.",negative
The House in Fata Morgana,"The House in Fata Morgana has won several awards over the years.  Recognized as being a visual novel with an interesting plot, it often tops several players' lists of recommended titles for new fans of the genre to try.  Is it worth your time and attention?  It will have to depend on your personal tolerance for several different factors.DIALOGUE. LOTS OF IT.As expected foranyvisual novel, Fata Morgana is not the exception.  This is a game meant to beread; you spend most of your time reading through messages, checking the backlog, and deciphering the mystery that it doesn't initially present to you (though it does in bits and pieces).  This isn't the major problem that I had with Fata Morgana.  Rather, my main issue with the dialogue is how slow, repetitive, and plodding it can be.Unlike something like the Phoenix Wright series, where quips and jabs are often fast, quick, and snappy, Fata Morgana has a very decidedly slow pace.  Characters sometimes take forever to ultimately speak what is on their mind and dance around the issue ad nauseum.  It can be frustrating, particularly if it feels like you're just clicking away at text boxes until something new finally pops up.That pacing, I would argue, is part of the charm of Fata Morgana.  It's lauded for its moody and at times sinister atmosphere, and it dares you to stop because of how meandering its plot can be.  While each of its twists are fairly well done and can make you stay seated and attentive for a few more minutes longer, your mileage may vary in terms of how long you intend to let the game get away with some of its more indulgent sections.The ultimately storyline - which I won't spoil for you here - does have some interesting thoughts and themes in it.  The way it turns quite a few times, despite all seeming disparate, does come together in a way that feels conclusive and thought out.  Again, how long you are willing to sit it out and stay is going to be up to you - for what it is, I wasn't a fan by the end, despite some of the hooks really getting me engaged early on.THAT MUSIC...!If it's not the story, then at least the OST of the game is something to behold.  It's gorgeous: mixes of choir voices and a soloist, singing in what I've read is Portuguese (heavily accented) with at-times tragic, other-times haunting melodies. Not all of the pieces hit with aplomb, but the ones that do really hit hard.I invite most people to at least sample a few tracks on YouTube.  If the game doesn't seem like it's for you, the soundtrack can be separately purchased and I would argue that it's a fairly great buy.All in all, the game is for a niche audience.  I wouldn't say that it's necessarily the title that would open up the genre to a new set of players - there are other genre titans that I think do it better - but for those already mired with the VN crowd, this could be a decent addition to your library to sit through.",negative
The House in Fata Morgana,"Sorry but I really can't appreciate the character building and the storytelling. I guess this has something to do with expectation management, I heard too many good things about this game but in the end I'm not really impressed.I think the main reason is that the negativity of the entire story line is too strong. Don't get me wrong, I am fully capable of appreciating dark and complicated, or even twisted plots, just that I think a good story should have a realistic balance between good and bad choices made by all the characters, there should be a balance between darkness and light in the human nature (if you bear with the cliche terms). In this game, it seems that >90% of the characters ALL MADE THE WORST POSSIBLE CHOICE THEY COULD EVER IMAGINE. Hence, for me the story felt more like purely lashing out on negativity, yet weirdly and miraculously (not in a good way obviously) came about with a happy ending, where almost everyone suddenly received some sort of redemption.If I am 10 years younger I would have fallen for this kind of plot, but absolutely not for now.",negative
The House in Fata Morgana,"I tried, I really tried but this game is just so unbelievably boring. I kept playing thinking it HAD to get better around the next corner because of the reviews. Nope, it didn't. Save yourself the time, it's not worth it.The music is fantastic, holy moly is it ever good. The art is also top notch.It's the story and the characters, 14 hours in and I still feel no connection to any of the characters at all. The only times I was having fun was in between the different stories.If you find yourself getting bored a little bit after the first story just give up and save yourself the hours, it's not getting better.",negative
The House in Fata Morgana,"Caught my attention at times but ultimately disappointed. I was immediately struck by the high quality of prose in the English version. As I viewed the stories as sort of a loosely connected anthology of tragedies, I think that I came somewhere near a vague appreciation. But ultimately, the story is driven heavily by an obtuse and meaningless net of overarching supernatural mish-mash, and every part of the story Ididlike ultimately overstayed its welcome. Couldn't bring myself to finish it, particularly for how egregiously it began to drag on without anything else particularly interesting to say or twists to throw in as a cheap trick to keep my attention a little longer.I can't say I think Fata Morgana is good, but at the very least I recognize it was important. I can tell how impactful this VN was, and I also deeply appreciate its exotic style of presentation. While I want to enjoy those kinds of innovations, sometimes it's just not enough to make a good story.",negative
The House in Fata Morgana,"Boring, predictable and emotionless. I dont really understand the high rating here and on vndb, but i guess its bc Weebs never actually read a real book in their life. Every episode (door) ends with some cheap reddit tier twist like ""oh you thought man was.. bad? you had a strong emotional reaction to him? but what if he was... a victim of circumstance....""",negative
The House in Fata Morgana,"The second door (especially the beginning part) and some early interactions with the maid created a unique mystery experience. But the rest of the story developments were easy to guess and stereotypical of the genre. The dialogues and narration were unnecessarily verbose and usually unconvincing. I could tell what the author wants me to feel but the writing wasn't creative enough to accomplish that, like it keeps talking about pain and despair but the situations that arise weren't complex enough to get emotionally invested into. The villains of the stories were mostly portrayed as simple and narrow-minded people so the tragedies didn't have much weight or didn't feel fated, hence no despair (except for the second door which was complicated by the twist).Context: I also had problems with Umineko being verbose but I was pretty invested in it.",negative
The House in Fata Morgana,"Product received for freemaybe they have twisted plot, one that kinda new and all but there is no helping the way they told their story. It's too long, boring and really, it's just the ideal that count, I find myself constantly drifting away in the middle of each story. They beat around the bush too much, I understand that it is their attempt to build tension, mislead the reader so the revealing part would be more thrilling but no, it's just backfire. You know after the long story, build up all tension and struggle and all that, ideally you should end it with the most high note and the end, but unfortunately, they do a contrary, constantly, build up and hurry up come back to the normal long boring stuff, tell the same story over and over. They have  no talent to become a storytellerSound effect and soundtrack are all there to help you to get sleepy easily, so very average..Don't let them trick you into buying other music DLC, not worth a penCharacters art work are beautiful but background are utterly terrible, I'm surprise myself for how lazy and poor they areThey try so hard to create all misfortune and tragedy to push into their characters, but the way they solve it is incredibly hypocrite, specifically those last chapters...I play till the end because I don't want it unfinished, just that only",negative

There were quite a few parts where the conversations were just going in circles, repeating the same thing over and over. I understand that half of that is to build tension, but it was just excessive. There were some chapters where it was just a slog to get through.",negative

The House in Fata Morgana,"EDIT2021: Editing it as to not mislead people into thinking this is not worth it.After years, i gotta say, this is a story that stays with you for life. You won't forget it. Ever. However, i'd love steam to have a ""middle"" option between thumbs up and down. It's hard to say. I madly love this story, i dislike this game. Can't put it any other way. If you buy it, do remind yourself that you're buying more of a book, not a game. A loveable, loveable book. There's no story such as this.------------------This game has to have the most sweet and heart-warming ending i've ever seen ever. Perhaps the best OST i've heard as well. Not to count the fact that it has all the aspects i like in a story; plot-twists, reincarnation, tragedies, moral aspects and romance. All in all, it is truly a masterpiece in terms of story and emotional value.However, i can't bring myself to recommend it either way. And i'll explain why.Although the characters and story are pretty good, i could still not bring myself to enjoy a lot of aspects in it, which kinda broke my immersion to the game and at times i'd find all of it just silly cliches. Even if the storytelling is amazing.The game tries too hard to be over-positive in the main characters's perspectives and only few feel actually... Realistic and organic. I could sympathize more with the ""villain"" than the ""heroes"", in a sense.And it is sometimes â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ INFURIATING to play. The game reeeeeally insists hard on a morally ""good"" vision and you're forced into it. You have no influence over what ""your"" character does, and sometimes you'll be like ""what the heck, i don't want that"", but the game will force you towards a path that you don't have a say in, even though it feels like you should have.The choices you make in this game are the so called ""illusions of choice"". You either pick right or wrong. And if you pick wrong, you get a bad ending. Simple as that. Your interaction in it is close to zero, and at times that will REALLY get on your nerves. The environment is hateful, but you can't succumb to hate, you have to always be the good guy. And that, by itself, kills my immersion.I'd say... Amazing and heart-warming story (seriously one of the best), not-so-amazing experience.",negative
The House in Fata Morgana,"I played the switch version fyiTo begin, I am not the target audience for this time. I enjoy VNs, but that is tantamount to saying I enjoy experiencing fiction, a near universal hobby. I believe that a good story should captivate its audience, treat them with respect and not waste their time. FM grasps at these ideals, never managing to tell a truly engaging work. Itâs a low-budget VN at the end of the day.TL;DR, if the game looks appealing to you, play up to chapter 2. If youâre hooked by chapter 1, youâll likely enjoy the entire ride. If not, chapter 2 is at least an absolutely wonderful read on its own merits.I will mention when the spoilers will begin.To speak of the positives first, the sound design in this game is soothing. There are over 5 hours of music for this game, and all of it is wonderful. There exists a constant theme of melancholy throughout the VN which is amplified in the score. It has a very distinctive Western sound. Unfortunately the songs are regularly segregated based on which arc of the VN the player is currently reading through and will easily hear the same five or so 3 minute songs for hours on end. Personally I enjoyed the music, even though it was very repetitive.Apart from the music, the use of audio is quite effective at punctuating the horror. While I cannot recall every single word, the feeling I had listening to the sound effects used made it all the more graphic and disturbing. Unfortunately the steam release has no voice acting of note, which is a shame.The visuals are hit-or-miss. Some characters are breathtakingly striking, whilst others are laughably amateurish. Some background scenes immediately capture oneâs attention and others look more like blurred stock images.Drifting into a more neutral realm, the game is not very accessible. Like an old boomer, I have difficulty reading small fonts. Itâs a shame that a VN of this renown has no text size option, yet it does have a useless text box opacity slider. I doubt that more than a handful of people who read this would find umbrage with the text format.From here on I will be discussing the writing and there will be SPOILERS.I will start by reviewing the sections in chapters.The opening prologue sets the tone for the entire story. Itâs a meek, dim world that hints at a larger mystery. Much like the entire game, the answers to the mystery are obvious at this point, but deliberately obfuscated to the reader in order to create suspense. Looking back, itâs quite a weak and ephemeral start that does nothing to grip the reader. If nothing else it reminds the reader that this is a sad story and you will feel sad. There are no happy endings.Chapter 1 is quite good, I think. Itâs perhaps a bit cliched but itâs told well. The characters are developed to exactly the level they need to be while still maintaining suspense for the reader and the twists occur precisely at the right moments while still maintaining that this is but merely one story throughout a wider tale. I suspect that the vast majority of readers stopped the VN after finishing this chapter.Chapter 2 is excellent. I will even go so far as to say itâs a masterpiece of bad writing. Much like other classics of its genre, it is so embarrassingly terrible that it loops back around to be hilarious comedy. The entire chapter I could not stop thinking about Raiden from Metal Gear Rising. Itâs a prepubescent murder-hobo fantasy story, and I adore it. Itâs so cheesy and over-the-top that I canât help but laugh. I imagine if this chapter was dubbed in English it would truly be the pinnacle of comedy. Also there is a subplot about a girl in this chapter that is 100% worth skipping the dialogue for. Itâs the usual no happy ending story again.Chapter 3 is fine. I find the art for several characters in this arc to be quite appalling which did not help matters. The crux of the story relies on everyone involved being very stupid and being mocked for being stupid. Much like the last chapter, it feels half-baked.Chapter 4 is a bad story intentionally written to be dull. Just because itâs bad on purpose does not make it less bad. Reading the text at this point felt like an immense chore. The self-insert murder-hobo character directly informs the audience that they are stupid for having any sort of feeling for what theyâre reading. Very foul whoever came up with that clever idea. Again, itâs another passable no-happy-ending love story like all the rest.Chapter 5 is truly horrid. Not only is it filled with typical anime-cliches, but ventures into the realm of nonsense as characters begin making insane choices as the script demands that certain events occur. Itâs a story of gratuitous negativity to the point of absurdity. At the end of the roller coaster ride through hell, the MC brushes it all off as if it never even happened (never cleaned her hair either, guess the author just forgot about that). Simply a repeat of chapter 4 but more jaded and less whimsical.Chapter 6 is a waste of anyone's time to read, and the author knows it. At one point there is a several minute-long sequence of different character sprites simply emoting at one another without any dialogue. Itâs the most blatant, horrible padding possible. The entirety of this chapter is flashback garbage. My advice, fast-forward through the entire chapter until you reach a choice. I promise you you will not be confused when you finish it. Simply a repeat of chapter 4, again.Chapter 7. At this point, the reader has read chapter 4 three times and is about to do it again, but from yet anotherâs perspective. Of the chapter 4 variants it is certainly the best and provides the most important backstory, but that doesnât change the fact that reading this is a snoozefest. There are many moments that take place outside of the chapter 4 frame-of-mind that are neat, especially between the witch and the MC, but theyâre few and far between. There is a very touching scene between the MC and the main love interest, but again itâs one sequence in a 7-8 hour read. Iâd imagine one could get away with skipping 50% of the content in this chapter and not miss any substantial context.At last we arrive at chapter 8 which dares to tell a new story (bikurishitta). It starts with the horrible japanese cliche of all problems being solvable with the magic of friendship that is so prevalent in the stories that that island produces.That said, it's a bittersweet conclusion and an excellent chapter to end the story on.",negative
The House in Fata Morgana,"This â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ sucks ð¥ð¥ððOn a serious note though, this game was recommended to me. And as I enjoyed some of the visual novels previously, I thought I should try it.Well, the first 20 hours were quite interesting, after that the game started to slowly become unbearable, despite how invested I was in the story and finding out the ending of it all.But let's start with what it does good:- Characters - Amazing, I fell in love with the characters, with their behaviors, I felt the need to be attentive to every single detail trying to portray what they actually are. I was intrigued of what would happen next with them, and, yeah, it kept me interested first 20 hours at least- Music - The soundtrack is gorgeous. It fits the atmosphere, the mood of the story that the novel is trying to convey incredibly well. I found myself just stuck on some of the screens listening to the OSTWell, that's about it. Now to the issues I have with it. It actually pretty much falls into one place and that's how The House in Fata Morgana handles its storytelling.- Repetitive. The game really does that trick a lot of you having to go through the same encounter you had before but slightly from a different perspective. That feels really dull and excruciating. And it wouldn't be a problem if it did it a few times, but it really does that A LOT. I still didn't forgot what happened previously, game, thank you, you don't need to remind me and go into every single detail about the tiniest speck of dust that was in the scene.- It really drags out. Because of the issue above and some particular game design decisions it really really feels longer than it should be. Like, I was almost at all times aware of the state I am in, but the game felt the need to describe it to me like I was an infant. Not once I have found myself understanding what happens next and what consquences it has and being bored, while the game had this urge to shove everything down my throat once more, to make sure that I've been a good boy, attentive reader and understood what impact it had on the story.- Illusive choice. Choice doesn't really matter in this game. What I found appealing in the other VNs is that you can change the way of things by going with different answeres. That way you really could be kind of a creator of your own story, your own narrator of sorts. The House in Fata Morgana completely removes that from the game by putting a dead end if you make the choice that the developers did not intend you to. So you pretty much have only one story line. I want to make mistakes, I want this experience to feel personal, but they are just giving me no choice at all. I can't tweak it to be MY journey, it's just someone's journey.To sum it up. The House in Fata Morgana has a good basis to be a good visual novel, but for me it fails to do that by utilizing really bad practices for a genre, where you want a player to be immerced with your story, rather then felt exhausted with it. The game creates a wall between you and the events taking place in the plot, rather then unifying you with the amazing world it's trying to build.",negative
The House in Fata Morgana,"I feel like this game should have been much shorter. The stories behind the doors are ranging from ok to interesting, and the pace is very slow. Nothing inherently wrong with that, but that kind pace is hardly justified, given how painfully repetitive the dialogues are. I'm finding myself skipping most of the lines just to reach a point where there's finally some progress. The music and the artworks are really curated, at least.",negative
The House in Fata Morgana,"The House in Fata Morgana is a spiral, but instead of going up, it goes down.I dropped it at the end of door 5, because i wanted to give it a fair chance, as everyone told me that the game gets better, and i believed them as the first 2 doors were promising. First two doors had a slight pacing issue, but they were pretty solid. But after the first 2 doors I was basicly forcing myself to play through door 3, 4 and 5, as the pacing got alot worse. After door 5 i had enough as the story seemed to just prolongue itself to infinity, disguised as a Rent-A-Girlfriend manga.And the biggest mystery to me is the lack of mystery/suspense in this VN. I was told to play this as a first recommendation after i finished Umineko no Naku Koro ni, and that the main selling point was the mystery. Also the trailer and steam tags suggest the same (mystery being the 4th tag and suspense being mentioned in the trailer). Majority of the twists felt forced, not exciting or predictable.Music was solid, but I felt it lacked in some departments, like memorable tracks and a suspense track. CG's were pretty good.As far as mystery/thriller visual novels go, I dont recommend The House in Fata Morgana, instead I suggest you to buy something else like: Umineko no Naku Koro ni, Chaos;Child, 428 Shibuya Scramble, Zero Escape, Danganronpa, G-Senjou no Maou...If you want a romance/drama this could be a good choice though, as first two doors were solid, and i can see why people like Door 3,4 and 5.",negative
The House in Fata Morgana,"Look, I know that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but some of these glowing reviews make me wonder if these folks have dipped their toe into narratives beyond school-assigned readings or a Christopher Nolan movie.The House in Fata Morganahas some interesting ideas in it and a poignant backstory ofan intersex/trans character, but overall, the experience is painful not because of heartrending moments, but because of glaring issues in many facets of the visual novel: the interminable length, the jarring pacing, and the abysmal prose. This writerdesperatelyneeded an editor to remove ridiculous phrases like ""please pardon the trite analogy"" and ""in what seemed like a metaphor for her life"", but beyond that, whole blocks of text should have been stricken (even ignoring ellipses and onomatopoeia for laughter that would've been better served by narration). By the final chapter of the story, I was constantly tapping the space bar to skip dialogue that was repetitive and also provided no character development or motivations beyond ""these characters love each other.""I have many other issues withTHiFM:  the characters were mostly either flat or not remotely relatable, the sound design was unpleasant, and the story included an excessive amount of what I'd characterize as ""trauma porn"". But I can at least say that while the music didn't always maintain stylistic consistency (which is par for the course with multiple separate composers) and repeated quite a bit, it was original in a way I appreciated. (I particularly enjoyed a low-key track with vocals that reminded me of Bjork.)tl;dr Some of y'all need to raise your standards a little beyond media that contains one character accidentally grabbing another's boob.",negative
The House in Fata Morgana,"spoilers belowthat was a beautifully amazing masterpiece of a story. the music was amazing, the artstyle was unique and fun, and over all it was just so well written and great to read. until the chapter started where you ""went back in time"" to try to save morgana and change the men who killed her. it was incredibly boring. you learn nothing of the story in that chapter. every thing that happened in that chapter were things you already knew. we knew what happened to morgana and what the men who killed her likely felt about what they did. because we already saw their personalites and decisions they made before in their reincarnated lives! everything that happened in that chapter was obvious from the second morgana finally told the player her story. she was better at telling the story too. she explained everything much better, in a much cooler, and much much shorter way. it took her only a few paragraphs to explain it. but still the game makes you sit through literally hours of dialouge right after just to learn nothing new about what happened. and then right at the end it reveals that an adult man reveals that he is in love with morgana. morgana was 12 years old when she met him and he was 21. he had feelings for her since and even admitted them to her at age 16. it was just gross and creepy. i dont care that he said he would """"wait for me."""" he shouldnt have caught feelings for a prepubescent child. thats not the first questionable age gap that shows up in the story either. its just a weird theme that persists through the game. would not recommend this game if you dont want to have a horrible time.",negative

The House in Fata Morgana,"On one hand it's got an intriguing plot line, charming music, and a vivid yet non-taxing writing style.On the other, all it seems to want to do with that is enrage the reader. I simply did not have a good time reading this, and cannot recommend it.",negative
The House in Fata Morgana,"Pointlessly long and over stretched despite a few good moments and nice music.

It was extremely disappointing to find out, and I miss my money.",negative
The House in Fata Morgana,"The House in Fata Morgana is a low budget visual novel of the utsuge (sad game) variety. The graphics are made for the old school resolution of 800x600 (even though the game came out in 2010), only the main characters have sprites, the backgrounds are heavily filtered photos. There's no erotic content or gore, hence nothing to censor in the Steam version.Having said all that, the main draw should be the story, right? Well, while there are some nice ideas and plot twists here and there, this was all padded to hell and back, as it often happens with low budget Japanese visual novels. The audience won't feel compelled to pay full price for a ""short"" game, so the writers try to draw out the story as long as possible. There's tons of repetition with endless flashbacks, characters repeating the same things over and over, overexplanations and exposition dumps for every little thing, the same scenes told via different POV's etc. Easily half of the game's 40 hour playtime is filler.The soundtrack is one of the few things going for Fata Morgana, but I feel it works a lot better outside the game as the loud vocals can be very distracting in-game and you will eventually end up turning the music off.I'm surprised that most reviews on Steam are positive, but not surprised at all that the sales are so low. It's very hard to pinpoint what would be this game's target audience.",negative
The House in Fata Morgana,"I wanted to like this game, in spite of its slow start, but sadly just as it was finally starting to get interesting, I ended up with error pop up messages all over the place. Validated the files and it's installed properly, so I have no idea what the cause is. It doesn't crash the game, but the pop ups over and over really get annoying fast.",negative
The House in Fata Morgana,"Full spoilers ahead!The 1st door story was so unimaginably bad, illogical and all over the place already, that by 4th I kinda assumed the game ultimately would be about telling some fairy tale grade stories and then allowing to rewrite them into something realistic and humane. Nah. Despite what multiple characters would tell you, every single story in there is the same ""beautiful tragedy"" stuff you read in 4th, though you're supposed to differentiate it somehow.Well, the beauty in that is questionable, but I do not think the 4th was that beautiful either. One thing I genuinely liked there was the hidden messages for you to find, it was clever and fresh. But most of the storytelling in this game was not.The end drags on endlessly. The walls of ""................"" and names on repeat are not really adding anything to most of the scenes. Going around to talk to same people saying same things is not interesting.The amount of suffering of every thing alive and dead alike is just ridiculous and makes it hard to care what shiny new horrible thing happens yet again. In my country, we once had a writer named Lidia Charskaya, who wrote a ton of books about sensitive young girls prone to fainting and misery, and the prose here surprisingly reminds me of her creations, though she couldn't imagine it to be compared to such a bloody tale, I assume. But shaking off the feeling of similarity is impossible.The 1st door, in retrospect, ruins the character - well, it's not like anybody could miss her - of White-Haired abomination, who is supposed to be the best of the best of them saints too good for this sinful Earth. Missy plans to kill the kid who never done her wrong (arguably, even his family didn't do much besides dismissal of the employee) and almost goes through with it. While that actually is the blissful moment the character shows something akin to spine, are we supposed to just forget all of this has happened by the end, where she is revealed to be pure angel who would never so much as raise voice or something? Honestly, the ""villain"" of that story is the best stuff you can get there (but she stops being so fun afterwards, which is a pity).The reincarnation process where everybody is forever the same person with same name and appearance and connected to exactly same people in exactly same way seems kinda boring. Yeah, yeah, tastes differ, but there are deeper problems with it. It does seem to miss logic in what is reconstructed and what is not. Like appearance and name are important, but family and profession are not, why? Well, who knows.More importantly, learning the same facts again and again can bore you out of your skull. If some buddy is a coward, you will read about it a hundred times - and the amount named is probably too flattering. I guess, even without the reincarnation theme, that's just the style the creators are going for. So the only thing I could agree on with Yukimasa is his ""Yes, I know myself already, you don't have to tell me"" in the extra. That was infinitely refreshing among all the useless banter of ""You were bad..."" - ""No... Maybe... I didn't want to... But I did... Agggrh I'm the worst...""Every thing that is not supernatural, or wait, even the supernatural included, is resolved with the power of love, but the romance is nothing to write home about. Main couple is just as bland & extraordinarily nice as they come, and when people are going through hell for one another, you usually get some sympathy, but I can't. I can't, like I can't listen to some of the most grating singing someone thought would be good to loop for hours in this game.Well, to conclude with something, I don't even think the gameâs not worth the attention, some ideas rock and Iâll probably still go for the long list of side content. It is fun to complain about and it has Morgana in it. Her story is as absurd as any other, but she herself at least is a little sarcastic ray of sunshine.",negative
The House in Fata Morgana,"So far it all has been very good, the writing included, but I have now come across a scene that has compelled me to write this. Please, correct the malapropism in the 'How She Sees the World' scene. It is very bothersome.

The House in Fata Morgana,"PROS:* Interesting concept for a story, has potential. I can see what the creators are trying to do.* The story was engaging enough to make me want to know what the solution to the mystery would be. In short, I wanted to see the ending.CONS:* Too much drama too fast. There is no chance to emotionally catch up in this, which made me feel jaded after the initial drama moments. I think the game was supposed to make me feel deeply emotionally affected, which many other reviewers attested to, but it just tired me out and made me very detached instead. I also suspect that many persons that feels like this is a mind blowing masterpiece of a story may be quite young and may not have experienced a lot of personal drama in their lives.* People in the middle ages, I assume did not say ""welp"". Moments like that pull me out of immersion.* I do not think the music was that special, it was quite repetitive at times and I even turned it off when it became too annoying.* One of the achivements isto replay the game to find a paltry few hundred lines which feels very disrespectful of the player's time.-----------------------------------------If I could have voted Neutral, I would have. Now I will vote that I do not Recommend this game to balance the number of positive votes the game has, of which I think it is undeserving. It is an ok game, but not as good as the reviews make it out to be.",negative
The House in Fata Morgana,"This review is spoiler freeThis is the same category as Nier: Automata: It is praised as gem of gaming but it is merely glass and glitter. I don't know why so people love it, but I will make my case and I will argue about the tons of problems this visual novel has. And yes, I know its a visual novel so I won't be judging it for what is isn't.The duration: 29 hours. It is way too long for the story it wants to tell. You will see why it drags that long and why does it feel endless, but in 30 hours I can: Complete the whole Bioshock trilogy and still have sometime left. Games like Senua, A Plague Tale, Alan Wake have way better narratives and take a third of the time.The premise: The story is about the mansion in which a witch was living. You see the stories interwoven with the mansion throughout the centuries and you will discover what happened. There are a ton of mysteries and the game reveals all of them bit by bit. It is a nice concept, and I appreciate it.The characters: Are bad. Laughably bad from every perspective. They are extremely non realistic so you can't take them seriously. They are two dimensional which means that they have only 2 main attributes that always contradict with each other. The point was to show that the villains are not evil but they have a good side, but on one instance they can be full black and on other full white. There is no gray area with the characters, they are saintly good and sadistic pigs. Their motives are either childish or non-existent at all and that means that you can't feel empathy with them.The stories: Are bad. It's if someone read Sade's ""Justine"" and stretched it over 30 hours. It has some nice ideas and the main concept of ""acceptance and prosecution"" work. But the events that take place are so outstretches and so ""anime-like"" that can't be taken as serious social commentary and therefore the fantasy-supernatural element of the story feels more real than the real events.The dialogues: Are anime. That means that a) they annoyingly repeat info you know, b) they pointlessly drag out the dialogue without any substantial value. c) they are trying to be literature but fall flat, d) they hinder the pacing of the story.Focus: The story is out of focus as it can decide which story wants to tell. It changes so frequently focus from one character to the other, that shatters the immersion and the reader investmentPlot twists: There are way too many of them. Think of it as this: You have a question or a theory. The game provides answer. Plot twist, there is more. Follow up plot twist, this is not how it looks like. Second follow up plot twist, it was the other way round. Third follow up plot twist, it was the original answer from the start. The game's plot twists are so inconsistent, that by the end of the story, you won't even care to be surprised.The pacing: Is bad. Without spoilers, the real story begins in chapter 4 so for 6-7 hours you're just in the prologue. And after hour 20 where you have the resolve of the story, the game throws another 10 h epilogue just to piss you off. The game criminally overstays its welcome.The choices: There are a few choices in this game all stuffed in the final chapter. Why is that? I do not know. It would be a nice idea to make choices that will actually affect the game but this is by far THE WORST choice mechanic ever created, where A SINGLE BAD CHOICE will end in a GAME OVER for you.The music: Is good mostly, exceptional in special places, annoying in others (see chapter 3)I spent 29 hours in this game and I regret it. I raged quit when a choice I made turned out to be bad which had no point as it was a simple choice and I had no way of knowing where it will end. If you are into this kind of visual novels and if you think One Piece should get a Nobel prize for literature, then this is the game for you. If not, stay away.",negative
The House in Fata Morgana,"I finished it. I can see why other people would like it but I can't recommend this to the average reader.The positives:-Gorgeous music-Nice character artwork and stills-Overarching story is compellingNegatives:-Biggest problem I had: It's WAY too long. The narrative likes to over-explore tangents that aren't terribly interesting. They ARE explored for a reason and ultimately have payoff, but they would have benefited greatly from being shorter. More obnoxiously, the narrative will retell large chunks of the story from different perspectives. While there's usually new information to give the retelling a spin, it still takes way too long. A strategic cutting of unimportant details would have served the pace greatly.-Not enough character art. For a story with this much runtime, there weren't a lot of pictures to go along with it. Considering the price, I would have expected more.-The environment art is disappointing. It's too abstract to give a good sense of the location.It was a struggle to get through all the way to the end without skipping. But I got there, and I've certainly had worse times. If you're going to buy this though, I highly recommend a sale.",negative
The House in Fata Morgana,"I played this offline with normal wine on Linux with the Windows' version of the game. For some reason Proton was not working as expected.This drags too much, which is a common problem in VNs. Half or more of the text is not needed, even more if you take in mind that there is a section where the creators explain their main motivations for the characters and the story.Taking too long decreases the quality of the product. I know it is hard to cut off things instead of freely adding everything, but this could be MUCH MORE BETTER with less content. This is my issue with this game. It took me months to finish it and there were times where I felt like giving it up because it was a pain.This reminds me much of Umineko, which is very long and bad paced in lots of parts, but with a complex and dream like story. I love the manga version of Umineko but I gave up the VN and finished it years later.The base story is good. Some chapters were very good (even being a bit too much), for example chapters: 1, 4 and 5. The characters are well done in general, but also is a bit sad how utterly dumb they behave.This is not a story for everyone. Some may enjoy it, but I am sure there is a fair amount of people who will not.",negative
The House in Fata Morgana,"Warning: Melodrama & Terrible pacing. Don't be fooled by its sophisticated window-dressing, this reads like a telenovela for teenagers.I could fill page after page with my thoughts on this VN and maybe I'll adjust my review once I'm completely done with it. It's not all negatives as there is stuff that keeps me hooked, the overarching plot is interesting and I wanna see it through.But I just have to put out this warning for people because the amount of glowing praise this VN has received as some sort of ""life-changing masterpiece of divine quality"" is ridiculous and going in with the sorts of expectations these people are setting will do your experience a massive disservice.Don't buy it blindly based of the ridiculous praise it's received. If you end up buying it; go in with tempered expectations.",negative
The House in Fata Morgana,"There are some strong aspects to Fata Morgana but they're held back by some very serious structural issues with the story as a whole.First of all, way too much time is spent on substories that only tangentially connect to the main plot. I understand their inclusion, but if they were going to take up so much time then the details should have mattered. As it stands, the key reason for each one's inclusion can pretty easily be boiled down to nothing but its most basic and superficial aspects.Second, the story places far too much emphasis on some of its least interesting aspects. This relates to the first point above, but is further compounded by parts of the main plot which overstay their welcome. I can't go into too many details for spoiler reasons, but in general the VN is at its strongest whenever it focuses on the internal dilemmas and introspection of its main characters, and at its weakest in the many times it strays from the internal in order to cover the external pressures and interpersonal relationships (especially the romances) those characters have. And, unfortunately, Fata Morgana strays into its weakest aspects far more often than can be ignored.There is still good material here but I cant give it the glowing reviews that it receives from others. If you are more willing to ignore a work's flaws and focus your attention on the positives, you'll likely have a much better experience than I did. But Fata Morgana stumbles way too often for me to ignore and it definitely hurt my overall enjoyment of the title as a whole. Not terrible, but certainly not an experience I'd be willing to recommend overall.",negative
The House in Fata Morgana,"Boy, the internet failed me here.  This is hailed by many as one of the GOAT VNs.  This isn't the worst VN I've ever read, but it's DEFINITELY in the bottom third.  I read 80% of it (on switch- my pc hours are not relevant) and then looked up the rest of the plot because I could tell this was going nowhere that interested me in the slightest.Now, one man's trash is another man's treasure, so I'll tell you what I typically like in a VN- I want twists, a good bit of mystery, plenty of world-building, all anchored by well-defined, likable characters.  Umineko, Fate/Stay Night, Ace Attorney, Centennial Case are all favorites.If you have similar tastes, you might want to reconsider a purchase.  Gothic romance is really what's on offer here, and despite reviews to the contrary, I didn't find the story particularly original or interesting.  I didn't even really like the character by the time I stop, which is a BIG problem.  I got as far as I did still wondering when things would pick up.One of the biggest problems is the prose.  Conversations go on forever without actually being interesting or building out the world well.  For a 30 hour VN, astonishingly little happens.  I just do not understand comments to the contrary.Also, the handful of twists are way over-telegraphed.  I was *never* surprised.The OST is...fine.  Probably the best part of the package.I just really don't get the accolades.  Just saying- you might not either.",negative
The House in Fata Morgana,"Man, I don't think I've ever seen a VN be bad in this specific way before. This one... hmmn. So, the pacing is just. Abysmal. Among the worst I've ever seen. This game has so many fake-outs and retellings of events alongside a generally slow speed of progression that it becomes absolutely, utterly exhausting to get through. What you think is the majority of the game's plot turns out to be only a third of it. By the time you've unravelled all the mysteries - you're two-thirds of the way through, and basically nothing of value remains past that point. And the last third is dedicated mostly to those retellings and fake endings while having only a small handful of new information gleaned, or heck, even new character interactions. Anyways I can't really get into why this fails without spoilers. So, spoiler warning below the line.----------So, the first chapter. It's really slow-paced and kind of obvious where it's going, and it then ends really unsatisfyingly without proper resolution until much later when it does. The second chapter - again, it's blatantly obvious who the second ""beast"" was and the way the last half of the plot unfolds isn't particular surprising, it basically blows its load right away and has nowhere to go from there. The third chapter is genuinely good and I honestly don't have any complaints about it, the pacing felt better, the main character being followed was unlikeable as hell but it had a good twist and resolution.The fourth chapter is 100% filler. There is no reason for it to exist. It's literally all a fabrication. It adds nothing to the game's bloated narrative because none of the interactions in it happened. And this is especially important because the fifth chapter is just the fourth chapter again, but this time an actually decent story, though this is where the game descends into a bit too much of heavy handed romance and outright misery porn. The sixth chapter is more misery porn, though it's presented in a novel style and does so succinctly without dragging things out, and reveals basically the core plot of the rest of the game too. It's done well enough, I suppose. The twist of the seventh chapter is revealed pretty much straightaway and then it wallows in misery porn again from there, though I will say that twist is pretty strong. But it's such an unpleasant ride to sit through, and needlessly so, and Aimee never even gets comeuppance for her actions like literally everyone else in the story eventually does. She's just... forgotten about, after.And that's where I thought the game would end. Or at least, there wasn't any real reason for it to continue past that point.So anyways, chapter 8 is a 5+ hour retread of the exact same story that chapter 6 covered, where you learn only a handful of new details and all the characters behave basically exactly the same as they did in earlier chapters so there's no new character interactions to glean. Mell's story has literally one point of easily guessable info, and his relationship and character were already very well defined before, so we learn nothing. It's a lot longer than it needs to be, and it doesn't even really need to exist in the first place. The Swordsman's story does at least give us some insight into his character, though it doesn't make him more likeable and doesn't really give any new plot details either. What Morgana said happened? It all happened exactly as described. Not the slightest change. Jacopo's story does have the one genuine twist in it, and it reverts to a novel style to tell it which, again, helps the pacing dramatically, so I don't reeeally mind it as much, but this was past the point where I was just flat exhausted.And then it turns out none of that actually happened and the tiny bits of information revealed were all that needed to be gleaned in the first place. Game over.Oh and, the white-haired girl is Morgana, but also, isn't? Kinda? And you kill her. Game over.And wait now Morgana is chill again so she frees the trapped souls. Game over.Except wait Didier's there too! And you have to free him! Also, Georges For Real dies in the process, being the only character who doesn't get an eventual happy ending. Game over.Oh and Giselle's okay too but now Michel isn't. Game over.Wait never mind they're both okay. Game over. For real this time. Finally.There's also apparently a sequel that is to my understanding just a retelling of the earlier parts of Morgana's story (aka before the last three days) which... you're really going there, huh? Taking the problems of this game and making an entire game out of them? Maybe that one genuinely fixes all the problems but after this mess I have no interest in checking it out.I will say, the art, for the most part, is pretty good. Giselle's sprites look kiiiinda creepy and bad, the backgrounds are all kind of abstract but ultimately identifiable. The music is good, really good actually, and helps set moods with lots of memorable tracks, probably the biggest highlight of the whole thing.But... yeah, I had trouble getting into this one, and then when I did, it decided to ruin it by going on far, far longer than it had any real reason to, which is ultimately a shame, since the potential for this story to be quite good is there - the core story itself, I do like, and it concludes satisfyingly enough, but the process of getting there is just too drawn out to make me feel like it was worth my time to get there.",negative
The House in Fata Morgana,"I would leave it a neutral review, but as steam doesn't allow it, I'll have to leave a negative one.The problem with Fata Morgana is that it is not a bad VN as such but it is a very boring one, like I'd say unbearably so, considering its length, and as it isn't really bad, you might think that you just need to man up and finish it, but... it never really gets interesting and here is why:1. Repetition, the worst crime a writer can commit, repetition is not good and it should be minimized, if it's required (different perspective from different characters), it should be done in such a different way as not to look like repetition.2. Screaming, moaning, and other random sounds doesn't transition well to the written form, instead of doing AAAAAAAAAAAs, author is way better of telling what a certain character feels, that's what literature is for.3. Characters are so one dimensional and shallow that they look like dolls with horrible stories for the most part. I don't need my literature to be realistic, no, but some depth to characters would have been nice. To be fair, it is a tad rectified at the end, but that's too little too late.4. Interminable fussing over every little detail, on and on and on.5. There is not enough going on for it being as long as it is.6. Some nitpicking: art is odd, static characters look nice, but sometimes when they change position or show emotion they look nothing like themselves. Backgrounds leave much to be desired.7. Final word, assuming that it is a mystery VN, it makes you wait for some suspense, and it is simply not there.",negative
The House in Fata Morgana,"The House in Fata Morgana tells a couple of intertwined stories through the centuries (flashbacks) while trying to keep a convincing portrayal of medieval times. But then, there's all this shÑt about souls, reincarnation, miracles and this magical mansion of wishes, revenge and regret bullshÑt, with magic/friendship solving everything, to tie them together. Each story individually would be sorta decent if the mystery aspects of the game weren't so pathetic, there are too many instances where they artificially hide information from the player to make the mystery work. And the ending parts of the story were too forced, with characters even going full 180Â°, and kept on dragging on forever with useless conversations.To make it worse, the game spends more time repeating over and over again through multiple characters that the story being told is tragic, sad, beautiful or whatever, than actually delivering such stories. It's as if calling people you don't agre with fascists/nazis would magically make them fascists/nazis. No it doesn't, and it makes everyone else not take you seriously.The translation is plain terrible. The english in itself is fine, but occasionally inserting a couple of outdated words into a script filled with modern day language and memes doesn't make the script feel authentic for that era, much less for an enjoyable reading. The ""translation"" team claim a specific TL decision was taken to make a sentence fit better for that time, but the entire script tells us otherwise.The art and soundtrack are pretty good, though the lyrics are in some unintelligible portuguese gibberish.Anyways, It's safe to assume that the spin off,A Requiem of Innocence, is a much better read, as it seems to avoid some of the issues like using magic all the time for whatever reason to move the plot, and it's not a bunch of flashbacks being told by someone repeating herself over and over. Besides, Morgana's story was the only redeeming one in all of Fata Morgana.",negative

The House in Fata Morgana,"This visual novel tackles timeless themes, most notably the cyclical nature of history. While this is a refreshing departure from typical visual novel fare, especially the prevalent nukige genre, it feels less innovative compared to broader media. The audio and art style, reminiscent of Saya no Uta, share a similar fate: unique, but not necessarily compelling. The writing, while functional, failed to truly engage me for extended periods.- - --Themes-The Cyclical Nature of History:This is perhaps the most central theme. The tragedies within the mansion repeat across different eras, with characters and situations echoing each other. This suggests that human nature, with its capacity for both love and cruelty, remains constant throughout time. It also explores how past actions and unresolved issues can continue to haunt the present.The Enduring Power of Love and Loss:Love, in its many forms (romantic, familial, platonic), is a driving force in the story. However, it is often intertwined with loss, grief, and regret. The story examines how love can inspire both great acts of kindness and terrible acts of desperation, and how the loss of loved ones can leave lasting scars.The Complexity of Human Nature:The characters in Fata Morgana are not simply good or evil. They are complex individuals with their own motivations, flaws, and strengths. The story explores the gray areas of human behavior, showing how people can be driven to do terrible things by love, fear, or despair. It emphasizes that everyone is capable of both good and evil, depending on their circumstances.The Weight of the Past:The past is not something that can be easily forgotten or ignored in Fata Morgana. It has a tangible presence, influencing the present and shaping the destinies of the characters. The story suggests that confronting and understanding the past is essential for moving forward and finding peace.Forgiveness and Redemption:Despite the darkness and tragedy, Fata Morgana also offers a message of hope and redemption. It suggests that even the most flawed individuals are capable of change and that forgiveness, both of oneself and others, is possible. The story emphasizes that breaking free from the cycles of tragedy requires understanding, empathy, and a willingness to forgive.The Search for Identity and Meaning:Many of the characters in the story grapple with questions of identity, memory, and the meaning of life. They search for their place in the world and try to understand their own pasts.",negative
The House in Fata Morgana,"I got this game (and its sequel) because it was recommended to me. After playing for six hours, I'm honestly pretty disappointed. I enjoy Visual Novels, but this one has given me only one choice to make thus far, and it was a meaningless choice. I've been led through one and a half story arcs without a single way of actually doing something in the game; it feels like I could put a rock on my space bar and it would have the same effect as me being there.The art is beautiful, the music lovely, and the story interesting, but I can get those things from a movie. The fact that I have so little avenue to engage as a player makes this pretty poor from the standpoint of a game. It doesn't help that the dialogue can be quite awkward at times and the characters don't always behave in a believable way (often when it comes to violent people being somehow 'redeemed' by the love of the people they're trying to kill, which I personally find a trite and irritating trope).I intend to play this game to the end, but I can't recommend that others get it, even other visual novel fans. I hope that we're building up to a point where I can actually do something as a player, but even if we are, I find it appalling from a design standpoint that I've spent so much time on this game unable to do anything as a player.EDIT: I have now played the whole game through. I will say that if you get the first twelve hours or so (during which you will only have two opportunities to affect the story), the game rewards you with a very rich story that will make you cry and also consider your own views on forgiveness, guilt, and justice. If you want a good story with beautiful music, then play the game and let it take you in. You'll enjoy yourself, and I know I enjoyed myself. That said, I still can't say I recommend it as a game, since it takes so long before you can actually engage as anything other than a passive observer pressing the space bar. Even once the game does offer you opportunities to engage in gameplay, the gameplay is often meaningless as presenting you questions with only one option, or questions where your answer doesn't matter beyond giving you funny dialogue.",negative
The House in Fata Morgana,"The House in Fata Morgana sounded very promising, the plot mysterious and interesting and the images do look absolutely beautiful. At the beginning of the game it is even advised to wear headphones to be able to take in the whole atmosphere and music. I expected great things.Well, forget about that.The music is cringy, overmodulated and somewhat strident. I had to put the volume down. Way down. Then off.Soundeffects like footsteps or the soft crackle of a fireplace are way too boisterous, it sounded like the whole mansion was burning down while the maid calmly stood there and talked to me.While the characters are drawn beautifully, the backgrounds are just a blurry mashup of ... I'm not even sure what I am looking at.The writing is boring, feels unnatural und forced, after ten minutes I just bashed the skip button to get it over with.It would've been better to buy a nice manga for the pictures. This game I cannot reccommend.",negative
The House in Fata Morgana,"After almost 20 hours in Fata Morgana and after having played many other visual novels in the past, I have to say I don't recommend this game. The story moves forward very slowly, there is a lot of repetition that is just wrapped in a different setting and the player isn't given much options with their choices (read: it takes a long time before you can even make ANY choices). The music and art are gorgeous but they aren't enough to make up for the lack of create your own story or choices matter that are common to this genre.People give praise to a good story and that they cried a lot during this game? I am just bored and would like for the story to even start. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy slow burn and a good tragedy but it doesn't have to take *20 hours* to get the story going.If you want to play this game, get it from a sale.

The House in Fata Morgana,"DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU ARE NOT A FAN OF ROMANCE.This visual novel is brilliant, don't get me wrong, but I didn't know this VN was about romantic stories, so I had a hard time sitting through the whole thing.

The House in Fata Morgana,"As a novel its about an 8/10 (great). As a vn ""GAME"" a 6/10 (above average) at best.Sound: music is a hit or miss some tracks are great, others are ear numbingly bad, nothing outstanding. no voice acting, which is outrageous! (yes even for a game that came out originally in 2012)Story:the most i can say without spoiling anything is as i said great, although too repetitive, by the 2nd door you can pretty much tell how every single door after that is going to go. and as far as the way it's told i personally found the first half pretty much unnecessary, only serving the purpose of setting expectations but nothing else.Visuals: i wish i could be more nuanced but the only word that comes to mind when thinking of the art is simply ugly, to be more specific the backgrounds, the character models are fine though. my biggest problem was just with how static everything is nothing is animated, the most you get is like a handful of variations of the character models and that's it, just disappointing when a VISUAL novel puts so little effort into the visual part.gameplay: press ""a"" (right click) simulator, at most you get a handful of dialog option and for a game that's 40+ hours long its just sad.if this was on sale for like $5 i could maybe tell you to give it a chance, but you might as well just watch a read trough of it on youtube and you wouldn't be missing anything, i would much rather you spend you money on the zero escape series, specially Virtue's Last Reward, which is in my opinion the epitome of the visual novel genre.",negative

The House in Fata Morgana,"God awful story telling, I don't know why people rate it so high I had to check it out, what a disappointment.The game has a lot of twists and turns, but they're nothing special or spectacular like people said in there review. Unless you're 12 and have never seen a drama before, maybe it'll impress you? I for myself am not a fan of drama genre, but growing up in Asia where drama is the most commonly watched show I've seen it all, NOTHING in this game surprised me.The game is a VN that heavily portraits negativity, it has disturbing scenes in it, murder, torture, domestic violent... But the way it drags those scene is just dreadful. Once you have scene the twist of each story, it needs to wrap up quick, but nope, let's drag it out.It has a mysterious setting around it, until they reveal the secret and it's nothing special, imagine putting yourself through those disturbing scenes for the sake of the story and you're met with the secret that you remember you've seen somewhere in a cheap drama...At least the art is nice, the music is decent except for the main song in chapter 3 it's atrocious, downright being cancer and doesn't fit with the type of game it is.6/10 is a very generous score from me. For the expectation from the story too high, it just fell flat.",negative
The House in Fata Morgana,"I dropped it after the first two chapters. From what I saw, the story is incredibly predictable and uninspiring and most of the dialogue is filler. There were a few mildly interesting ideas, but they were executed poorly.The only good thing about the art are the main character's standard sprites. The backgrounds are ugly splotches of color or filtered photographs and most of the drawn scenes look awful. There was one particular scene where a grown character's hand was literally the size of a child's, with incredibly thin, claw-like fingers that lacked proper joints. It looked like the kind of thing you'd see on DeviantArt.Definitely not worth the money.",negative

Some YouTubers praised it to be so amazingly good that they bought the physical release and I'm here with my ears bleeding.Then I had a very hard time with the boring dialogs of the kids. The boy is bearable but the girl was awful to listen to. Just an annoying brat. I had just hoped that these characters won't be there all the time. I was shocked when the boy was so easily talking about his grandfather dying while having sex. I would understand if it was the medieval era but during aristocracy? And he looks like 12?On another side note, characters using ""Ahaha"" and ""Okay""? Internet and 20th-century words? way to take me out of that era using these alongside older words.I was still bearing these hoping the story is amazing. Until I got into the first twist.A girl you met 2 days ago comes to your room to kill you and your reaction is ""I love you""? I know people have a hard time leaving toxic relationships but come on. Whatever boner you have for someone for 2 days won't justify that reaction.Don't get me started on the white girl's backstory. I am sure a good artist would find at least some job if someone fired them. It's not like they cut off his hands.

The House in Fata Morgana,"I cant believe this game has no negative reviews. I can see some people liking this game a lot, but not me.1. The story is not that goodThe mystery in the story is forced, there are too many pointless word-plays in the story, once, cool, twice nice, trice? It gets old. I do not want to go into more details because I will end up spoiling the story. But for multiple times in the story, it goes like this.A man is stabbed by a knife, you and your police buddies are going around crazy trying to find the murder weapon. Some random dude holding an apple came in and he was immediately arrested. Why? Because he was holding a knife and the knife's name is apple.What is the point of telling a story in this manner?2. The music is distractingBackground music for most parts of the story is good, but for some other parts, such as first half of chapter 1, it is insufferably noisy and distracting. I am looking for a relaxing time to read a book, but I cant read with the sound of a woman jibber jabbering in actual Japanese. Like do you listen to gangster rap when you read books?3. Art styleArtwork in this game looks great in selected screenshots, but its overall quality is meh. For example, the sprite for one of the characters when she lowers her head and smile in chapter 1 is outright bad.4. The cult followingThis game seems to be a perfect game to its fanbase that is immune to all criticism. In the comment section there are people describing how they want to have sex with a 50 year old woman (you know what i am talking about :D) just because I am openly saying I do not like this game.I stopped in the middle of chapter 2 and I really do not have the will to continue anymore. But because of all the forced mysteries in the novel, I went online and checked on the plot, just to realize how stupid the story telling is. Note here I am not saying the story is bad. Oh it is not bad, it is not good either. I would describe the story as a bunch of cliche classic tear dropping stories twisted together. It is the story telling that is really bad.Before you purchase this game, go to youtube and at least check out the story of the first 2 chapters, which is like 1/3 of the actual game. You will know what I mean by ""forced mystery"".And btw, fanboys, it is not a valid argument telling people ""you have no right to review this game if you have not finished it.""Well, this game is too bad for me to want to continue, and that is the whole point of my review. According to Steam stats 30% people finished this game, no?",negative
The House in Fata Morgana,"I had very high hopes for The House in Fata Morgana because I had heard people comparing it to the beloved manga Berserk. It being my favorite manga of all time, I was ready for a riveting experience with THIFM. Unfortunately I was sorely disappointed. As a disclaimer, this is pretty much the only strictly visual novel game I have played. Because of that, the closest thing I can compare it to would be Danganronpa which is a series I am in the process of completing. Do not be mistaken though THIFM is not a game there are no puzzles or interacting with the environment the story is told mostly through 2 people speaking at a time.My previous review was neutral but, after playing more of Danganronpa and seeing an alternative yet similar method of story telling, I'm really disappointed in THIFM. One of the worst aspects of the game is the terrible dialogue. Runtime is massively inflated with characters arguing in circles saying things like ""you're crazy!"", ""No I'm not!"", ""YES!!"" or having them just pause and say ""......................."" for 3 pages.Another major issue is how boring the story is. At the time of writing this review I have 7 hours. I skipped through the 3rd door and only stopped to get the main plot points because I was so bored. Based off the amount of text I skipped, I would feel comfortable saying it probably takes around 8-10 hours to complete doors 1-3. Why is this important? Because allegedly the story doesn't start being engaging until after moving past this point. I'm no stranger to a slow burn but the supporting stories are really just rather plain and do not entice the reader enough to continue.I could say so much more negative but I'd rather people read my review and it not be an 11 page essay so I'll just say there is more to THIFM that was not up to par in my opinion including the sound design and artwork. When looking at pricing this game is asking waaaay too much especially compared to trigger happy havoc which I am currently loving and is cheaper. I don't recommend buying this game. If you're curious just read or watch a video detailing the story and its characters.",negative
The House in Fata Morgana,"I wanted to like The House in Fata Morgana and forced myself to play through two and a half chapters, but the quality of the prose is absolutely atrocious, about on par with what you'd expect from a teenager's first assignment in a creative writing class with verbosity and repetiveness taking the place of wit and charm. Moreover, the writers largely use modern colloqualisms and elementary-school-level word choice for characters who are supposed to have lived hundreds of years ago, tossing in a few old-fashioned terms like ""abagail"" (which itself wouldn't have been used at the time) . The stories themselves were akin to dark takes on fables or fairy tales and not particularly surprising to any genre reader, but would be passable if an editor had actually tightened up the prose. It's a pity the writing is so bad as to make this such an unpleasant experience, as I did want to know more about the interconnected plot (though I can make some guesses as to how it turns out).",negative

The House in Fata Morgana,"brilliant story with awesome music and excellent artworks. the story it tells is touching, I even cried twice. HOWEVER I have to say the way of telling the story is extremely boring and repeatingï¼ the author clearly lacks the ability to organise those long stories in a way that makes the players feeling exciting. I used to feel touched in the game but when i finally finish one of the end it is THREE YEARS later. Every time I felt too bored and lost the willing of continuing exploring the story.I finally finish only one of the ending, it is the forth so it means there are at least four ending, each of them requires you to come back to see most of chapters which makes me soon give up trying to read the other endings. even with the skip function it is quite boring and long procedure, with the possibility that you make skip some different parts, because the UI is quite outdated, it wont warn you or stop you from skipping them. When I finally finish it i gonna say i feel so liberated and released from the burden and I never want to play it again.At the end I have to repeat my point: the story is good, the music is good, the artwork is good, all of the contents of the game are remarkable and deserve your time. But the unnecessarily long paragraphs and the way of telling the story ruined the gameplay experience (not surprising as many Japanese love stories have similar problems but this one goes further)",negative

Escape Simulator,"I 100%ed the game, but steam has no ""mixed feelings"" button so negative it is. The game has some really enjoyable highs but a lot of the puzzle design feels very mediocre and constantly hunting for random objects wears on you.Controls for how you interact/move/rotate objects feel a little clunky but you sort of get used to it.I spent most of my play time in co-op, and I have some thoughts about it.Each player having unique inventories means you semi-often end up hiding important information/objects from each other. The rooms are very clearly not really intended for two players, so you sort of end up passing all the stuff back and forth to each other as you take turns doing the ""fun"" part of completing the actual puzzles. In a boring room this kind of adds to the tedium, and in an exciting room you almost feel shortchanged because you're splitting the amount of fun parts you personally complete in half. But the rooms pretty much don't have the replayability to re-play to personally hit all the good bits.As far as escape rooms games on steam go it's certainly better than the free ones, but most of those are just asset repacks so I'm not sure that's high praise.Maybe wait for a sale, and only go for it if you or someone you intend to play it with is really into the genre.",negative
Escape Simulator,"I want to love this game.  It's so much fun when it works correctly but literally 80% of the games i'm in with someone else, the game either bugs and glitches and the map becomes impossible to complete because an item is stuck and won't move.  Even worse, however, is the client-host connection.  On certain levels the objects in the room do not sync up properly between the host and the other players playing the game meaning that both the host and their friends might constantly work on a puzzle and never complete it because it is always wrong to one of the people playing.   Because of this issue, I feel as though i'm always getting in the way of others and am actually being more of a hindrance than being of any help.  This is extremely annoying, makes me look like an idiot, and is just genuinely unfun to play.  Please fix these issues and this game will be absolutely amazing.",negative
Escape Simulator,"I gotta say.. This game has been *decently* fun but some of the puzzles are just.. obtuse. Intentional red herrings or bad visual design, hard to say, but at the very least puzzles can be subjective.What isn't subjective, however, are bugs. We spent easily 20+ minutes on one puzzle because a bug preventing one of the items from being interacted. I loaded a solo game and was able to immediately interact with the thing that we couldn't interact with for way too long. Super duper annoying and suddenly breaks my ability to take the game at face value.Another level later with pipes you turn? Unsolveable because the PIPE ROTATIONS GET OUT OF SYNC. Seriously guys?? It look connected on my screen and on my partner's screen it's.. not connected at all. Which one is right? This is utterly impossible to work around in a co-op puzzle-solving game.Another problem - when a player is holding or interacting with an item you can look at it with them and see their mouse pointer.. except the pointers are out of sync. Where they are pointing is NOT AT ALL where their mouse is on their screen, meaning if you're working over voice you can't even indicate things as clearly intended by the devs.Way too many bugs, hard no. Puzzle obtuseness and such is subjective, but constant game-breaking bugs are not.Yet another puzzle further in in another episode, same error.. My partner could interact with and move an item on a clock, I could not whether or not they were interacting with it or not. Started a solo game and I could immediately interact with it. bugged :\I also have to say.. as far as a *multiplayer* co-op games.. why are SO MANY of the puzzles offered ONE AT THE TIME. In a small, tiny space with only one puzzle to work on at once in a way that only one person can interact.. means anyone else is just standing around bored. Awful design if the intent is co-op from the ground up.",negative
Escape Simulator,"Look, this is a great concept with great core gameplay. I had a lot of fun playing this with friends, although with the right friends anything can be a blast. The idea of creating escape rooms you can do online is great, and the puzzles generally felt well designed enough to be fair but challenging, even if they are constrained to a single tiny room for most levels. That said, I have a few bones to pick with this game.This is an Early Access title, but it's not marked as such. The strange multiplayer lobby system will be your first tip off- you can Host, or Host (legacy). Serious, gamebreaking connection issues are common, ranging from intractable items becoming locked out for some players, to constantly booting one player from looking at an item when several people are viewing it (common especially on intractable items). My friends and I all experienced memory leaks resulting in consistent hitching every 2 seconds for several levels, since optimization is an afterthought. Settings offer very few ways of resolving issues or tweaking options, with several basic functions missing. Playing workshop levels with friends is a hassle, as downloading levels requires each player to find the workshop download individually.To summarize, Escape Simulator is in dire need of a thorough QOL, netcode, and optimization update. Probably several. Even the tiny size of most rooms feels like a vain attempt to improve optimization, and if that's the case it won't be long til other developers who can actually create a functioning multiplayer game will improve upon the escape room idea to great success.It's hopeful that with time, Pine Studio will fix these problems. If these were to be solved, I would happily change this review to positive, as I love games like this. Until then, this game is EARLY ACCESS. Pay if you're willing to deal with seriously annoying bugs and performance issues.",negative
Escape Simulator,"I love puzzle games and I wanted to play co-op with my friend, so we tried this out. I wish there was a 'mixed feelings' review instead of a yes/no, but I have to say I'm leaning to 'no'.Pros:- Victorian themed rooms were fun and intuitive- A decent amount of contentCons:- Buggy asf. We didn't trophy a room because one of the puzzles required us to put ingredients in the fire in order, and the second ingredient floated in the fire instead of burning. We had to do it 3 times before it registered.- Battery in a space room kept glitching in and out through the floor.- Items dropped out of bounds usually respawn in the middle of the room, but some items can get stuck at an angle with an invisible wall (Egypt top of pyramid room). Had to keep throwing an object at it to try and knock it out of bounds so it could respawn.- The controls are clunky.- Can't share item inventory, and trying to read a page with a friend makes the item drop. [Edit: After picking this game up months later, pages were readable without dropping. We weren't sharing pages incorrectly- we didn't do anything different, but it no longer drops].- Big items in the room can't be thrown into the trash can and end up getting in the way. A LOT. (In multiplayer, people are going to â¥â¥â¥â¥ around and remove paintings from walls. It's weird that you can't throw away the clearly decorative big items, but you can throw away usable puzzle pieces).---------------Weirdly, this game has a disproportionate amount of clown awards on negative reviews than other games, even those that only have 1 like. Honestly, I don't mind them because I get free points and everyone is entitled to their opinion, but it's a little suspect that in the past 3 months most of the negative reviews with 0-1 likes have clown awards, with one of them being commented by a dev- considering its not a new game and there were only a handful of negative reviews written in 3 months.I totally get if the comments were just baseless hate, but a ton of negative reviews- even the constructive nice ones- have clown reacts. Just... a little suspect.",negative
Escape Simulator,"For a multiplayer online game, there are massive issues with desync making some puzzles impossible with friends and leading to arguments. Not only this, but if anyone even disconnects, even if momentarily, your entire online session is broken as you get stuck on ""reconnecting"".The puzzles are pretty good but maps are horribly claustrophobic and full of clutter for no reason.Honestly, not a terrible solo experience, maybe play it locally with someone in the same room, but online it's borderline frustrating.",negative
Escape Simulator,"Fun at first. When the puzzles get more complicated and more abstract, it's difficult to see the actual logic in it all. It jumps from giving you all the pieces that you then put together yourself, to being a bit of a guessing game with hints. After my short amount of game-time I found myself going ""Really? that's the solution?"" several times, and that's not as rewarding as the previous ""ah yes, it goes in here I bet!"". I think the keyword is playing this with others, and because of the social aspect etc, it can be fun. If you want a good puzzle game, I'd look elsewhere.",negative
Escape Simulator,"Love it. The main created levels are awesome, the community levels can be a bit jank but I am so excited for more of this game.*****Edit:I don't recommend this anymore now to see that they only added two one room levels, one of which is an ad for their other game and the Christmas one feels like it was barely any effort. I'm really disappointed in these developers for making us feel like they were going to add more official levels to the base game to only come out with a DLC now and just push community rooms. I get community rooms are great and all, but we were lead to believe there was more coming to the base game and it's extremely disappointing there is not after what felt like a great start to a seemingly early access game.",negative
Escape Simulator,Its a fun game but I can't recommend this game for Co-Op. A lot of the time items will bug out for one person or the other. Meaning you can't interact with them anymore and its up to the other people in the room. Better hope they arent bugged too! Sometimes only certain parts of an object will bug out and you have to take turns setting it down and going back and forth to solve that puzzle. Pretty huge glaring issue right here. Needs fixed asap but don't see any urgency from Pine Studio. Also all of the levels that came with the game are ONE SQUARE ROOMS. Yeah Have fun sitting on top of each other in a super small room while you figure out similar puzzles to the last room. Overall a huge missed opportunity here and I'm surprised at all these positive reviews. Game could be way better.,negative
Escape Simulator,"Product received for freeI really want to recommend this game. When I can play it, I have a blast. But there is no greater disappointment than getting stuck on a ""Reconnecting..."" screen when playing with friends.I can see everything that's happening in the game, I'm clearing still connected to the game. But it has me stuck at ""Reconnecting..."" and it's not super fun to hear my friends go about solving the puzzle and having to hope my invisible cursor will hit the ""Return to menu"" button so my inventory drops for my friends.When it works, it's a really good game. Once they have some more polish on the game's network capabilities, I'll definitely make this a positive review. For now, I have to go negative. It's super fun to google the issue and find ""Fixed this issue!"" 2 game versions prior and lots of people still complaining about this issue after that version released.Item received as a gift from a friend so we could all play together.

Escape Simulator,"I'm reviewing this from single-player perspective only since I never wanted to dabbled into multiplayer stuff. I wish I could give it a neutral option since it's okay as long as you don't expect too much out of the game.Playing through the worlds surely takes some time but the puzzles were completely trivial and forgettable to me. Maybe it's the level editor aspect that is bottlenecking the mechanics to this generic feel.The human characters feel like wasted effort to me, they're just plastic and emotionless and don't achieve anything. Again, maybe in multiplayer experience they matter.There's no story and the puzzle worlds just exist in a vacuum. There are many good puzzle games with compelling story arcs and sense of accomplishment, and this game is falling short. The Last Campfire, The Witness, The Room series, Manifold Garden... all of these are vastly, vastly more compelling single-player experiences.",negative

Escape Simulator,"I donât know why but this game causes me intense vertigo. Iâve tried all kinds of different display settings with no luck. Iâve rarely if ever encountered this problem with a video game before. It might have to do with the overstuffed cubes they stick you in. It feels like an optometrist holding a snowglobe up to your nose and asking you to count the flakes one-by-one while shaking it around. Extremely nauseating.That said, while the puzzles are hit-or-miss, most of them are satisfying to solve. Perfect for 2 to 3 people, no more than that.But the cramped spaces and disorienting visuals keep me from recommending the game. I canât stress how horrible it is to run around the miniature rooms with a thousand objects whirling past, just to like place a block on a platform.

Escape Simulator,Latest update missing Steam achievements.The current implementation is just lazy (or they didn't even consider replayability). Every puzzle is hardcoded with zero differences so there is no point to ever play a map again.$15 for 5 hours of content (7ish for tokens and trophies) and a laughable amount of customization for your character is definitely not worth the price.Now they released a new DLC for $5 for 4 rooms.

There are many reasons why one might need to quit during a level, whether they are time-poor, or simply stuck, and want to tmove to a different level for now.It is an awful decision where they decided we should have to start again if we leave a level. They keep saying they are developing a Save feature, but still havent.",negative
Escape Simulator,"I want to like this game more but while there are some levels that have great themes, cohesion, design and puzzles that make sense and help lead to the next; there are just too many rooms with dime store garbage puzzles littered in them that lack any sort of relevance to the theme and have zero way to differentiate which clues belong to which puzzles.Taking an inordinate amount of time to compare spreadsheets isn't fun or challenging. Not having all of the data because you can't tell which muddled clue goes to which incongruous lock causes all victories to feel hollow as in you didn't solve a puzzle you just guessed; only rewarding a sense of relief that you don't have to play that level anymore.With controls feeling wildly different based on what level you are in or what you are interacting with and no reasoning for the change, the fact that you can accidentally hide clues from a coop partner, being unable to view/compare information without awkwardly wasting time trying to prop up or balance objects on a viewing surface and just the coin flip nature of whether a room was designed by someone who knows the definition of ""puzzle room"" and not a mouth-breathing, incontinent ape that just crapped puzzles into a room shows this game needs way more polish.There are community levels available in addition to the smattering of hit and miss levels included which could lead to a huge variety of well put together maps and massive replayability but until they fix or remove some of the poorer elements I just can't recommend this game. Top notch idea but still needs improvement to feel like it isn't a beta test case.",negative

Escape Simulator,"This is a very early impressions VR review based on the tutorial and the first room in Egypt.Firstly, thank god the music can be turned off.Secondly, VR implemantation is as basic as you can get. Controlling picked up objects in a natural way is non existent as your hands disappear when holding objects. Books dont line up properly in your hands and as a result you find yourself wishing fot two or three extra joints in your arm that would be required to properly view the pages. Having to drop objects as a last resort to reset the orientation is a big no-no = immersion breaking.Hopefully the VR interaction will get better as the developers get feedback but right now I do not reccomend this game if youâre getting it for the VR part.",negative
Escape Simulator,"Resounding ""meh"". I always liked the old flash escape games, and I've found this one to be a somewhat bloodless endeavour to recreate these in a better platform. The game is not inherently bad and I - again - wish steam had a ""so-so"" rating, but I never really got into it; neither the official nor the fanmade stuff I found particularly exciting. Notice how I didn't say ""easy"" there, but I might have been spoiled with games like the Witness, The Room series, Talos Principle etc.A bit of an unfair thumbs-down to be honest, but it didn't click enough for me to recommend it - I would've honestly forgotten that the game exists, had I not still installed it.",negative

There are so many better games in this genre, this one just happened to gain popularity from a few streamers who played it.It's usually not clever, most puzzles are either very easy or just don't make sense and make you go ""what?!"" when you see the solution. Important items could require you to move every single thing in the room and look at it from all directions.

However, it allows for co-op, advertises ""best with 2-3 players, but playable with more,"" but unless you communicate on the level of a high-level MMO raid team, it's a massive headache when you introduce co-op.  Object physics also get wonky when multiple people collide with it, with objects needed to solve puzzles sometimes clipping through walls or the floor.  Wouldn't recommend if you're planning on playing with other people.",negative
Escape Simulator,"I've played a lot of escape games growing up and in recent years (pre-pandemic of course) i had a lot of fun going to real life escape rooms, so needless to say i was very excited for a game aiming to simulate that experience, specially as a co-op one.I was however met with one major problem right from the start: For whatever reason, the game was giving me extreme motion sickness. For context i play lots of first-person games and this isn't really a problem i've faced before. Something about the movement in Escape Simulator made me super nauseous. I've messed around with mouse sensitivity, FOV, turned off mouse smoothing, reduced the brightness as much as i could (this game is *extremely* bright) and even turned on ""anti-motion sickness"" in the menu, which didn't really help at all either.I figured maybe i could still enjoy it if played in small bursts, so i waited a day and tried it again and yeah, i can play a couple rooms before i start feeling it, but it's still quite unpleasant and i really can't put my finger on why.As for the game itself...I feel it might be unfair to judge it based on only 2 hours of playtime, but i can't get a better grasp without going over the 2 hour ""no questions asked"" steam refund period so at least from what i played (one full collection of rooms as well as the first couple of rooms in two other ones) it was a bit... underwhelming?Instead of having a big interconnected space for you roam around and piece together puzzles, the collections are split into several extremely small self-contained rooms, with just a handful of puzzles in each and it's not that these puzzles arebad, it's just that the way they're presented is very straight forward. It feels way more like just a collection of puzzles than an escape room, like if someone was just giving you each crosswords prompt individually and have them be completely independent from each other.I've heard some workshop maps are bigger and have more intricate puzzles, but also heard the game gets really laggy in these (can't confirm for myself). It's also worth mentioning this ends up affecting co-op as well, since the puzzles are so self-contained everyone just kind of goes work on their own thing until the room is solved without actually requiring much communication/coordination.Another weird aspect is the timer systems, it's common for real life escape rooms to put you on a timer so that you have to escape the room before then, which really gives you some adrenaline rush that makes the experience a lot more exciting. Meanwhile point and click escape games usually didn't do the same since failing to meet the timer would either require players to replay puzzles they've solved already or give up and never see the end of the game. The way Escape Simulator opted to do it is to give you a timer purely for bragging rights, you're not required to finish before then but you suffer no penalty for failing it other than not getting a lil' trophy to mark the occasion. It's an interesting solution but it ends up falling short, as the lack of consequence means the timer gives you no rush whatsoever (specially from how much time they give you) and if you do fail you're supposedly encouraged to go back in and solve puzzles you've solved already.Funnily enough, the time i had the most fun with the game was when i had to rush to try and finish a room before my 2 hours ran out, the adrenaline rush of trying to finish a puzzle under an actual time limit was the closest i had to an actual escape room experience (even if i don't really think a strict limit with actual consequences would work in a digital game like this).Same goes for the tokens, which are collectibles you can find hidden in the maps. They're a nice bonus tbh, and it's fun to find them, but as a puzzle game i'm assuming it would be very unexciting to replay maps just to look for tokens you've missed (Though, granted, i haven't actually done that since i only have two hours of playtime to base myself in).In any case, maybe all these issues i had with the puzzle design were only present in the rooms i've played, were it not from the motion sickness i'd be more willing to put more time into it and give it a more informed review, unfortunately as it stands this is near unplayable for me and together with my indifference to the content i am unfortunately refunding it for the time being. If the motion issue is ever figured out and it gets some more exciting maps (even if through the workshop only) i'll gladly give it another try.",negative
Escape Simulator,"Disclaimer:I didnât try this in single player, I bought this game to play in two player co-op, based on the store page description ""best with 2-3 players, but playable with more"" as the main reason.I like puzzle games, I like co-op games and I really like co-op puzzle games, but unfortunately Escape Simulator fails in that department.For comparison, we can take a look at âWe Were Hereâ as an example for a game that does co-op well.âWe Were Hereâ is designed for two players in mind, putting each player in a completely different environment, giving them different tools and providing each of them with only half of the solution to the puzzle, forcing them to communicate and cooperate in order to win.In contrast, Escape Simulator seems to be designed for a single player with only minimal changes when playing in co-op;Each map is very small, claustrophobic and filled with many interact-able objects which you can pick up, and since each player can pick up things and store them in their inventory or throw them around (some of which can even break into many smaller pieces) it creates chaos and confusion as each player is looking at a different direction and is unaware of the actions of the other.When both players are in the same room it means you really only need one player to actually solve the puzzle and the other player is just in the way by blocking the view or interacting with objects.The only difference between solo and co-op is that some puzzles change slightly to force two players to interact with them simultaneously.For example in one of the rooms you need to adjust the position of 2 levers, when in single player you can just freely move them but when playing co-op the levers donât hold their position so both players have to hold them.Thatâs it, that's all that makes this a âco-op game, best with 2-3 playersâ.The game ends up being worse in co-op than just having one player stream it to the other while playing solo, because whatâs the point of having two or more (I canât even imagine what a nightmare this would be with more) players if they are both looking and interacting with the same stuff anyway.I do wanna note some features that I did like, although most of them just make the game better for solo play:The way you can pick up and throw items feels pretty nice.You can inspect and pin items to your screen (useful for notes etc.) and then move them around (though you canât resize them, and some have bad textures making it hard to read as it is).When a player is inspecting an item other players can join in and inspect it with them, with the caveat that while they can interact with things like buttons and dials, only the person holding the item can rotate and if he stops inspecting the other player gets booted out of it.Also worth noting about the above points, when inspecting, the game seems to take a snapshot of the screen and blur the background so you canât actually see whatâs happening in front of you (this caused some annoying situations and miscommunications until we figured that out). And more importantly, some items canât be viewed properly when âguest inspectingâ, when my friend inspected a remote control camera it worked fine for him but when I tried to watch what he was doing I just saw the camera rotating infinitely (which again caused some confusion) and I have no idea how thatâs acceptable for the developers in a multiplayer game.I think this game might be decent enough solo, but if youâre looking for a good co-op experience you should keep looking.",negative
Escape Simulator,"Played this game 2 player with my wife and really wanted to like it. The biggest downside is that the rooms are so small that it's hard to move around and see everything while playing multiplayer. The end result is a room that feels crowded, chaotic, and claustrophobic. The puzzles are great, it's just hard to navigate around the rooms to find all the clues when there's more than one person playing. I think we completed 3-4 rooms and then gave up on it.",negative
Escape Simulator,"Not a huge fan. I love escape rooms and puzzle games in general, and I have to disagree with other reviews - I think a lot of the puzzles are distinctly non-intuitive. For example: there are times that it will lay the clues out on a page with bolded phrases for you to combine, much like a regular puzzle, but because one of the phrases is changed you're supposed to ignore that phrase. Then why is it bolded to begin with? Maybe this is the norm for other escape simulator games, but as someone who has only ever done in-person escape rooms this method feels intentionally misleading. Many of the clues and game play aspects are non-intuitive and constantly running past the time because of some poor design brings frustration up to an 11 constantly. I had high hopes for this game but I'm really not into it.",negative
Escape Simulator,"Playing in VR is really smooth and such a fun way to interact with things.BUT -- It gave me and a friend terrible motion sickness after just 15 minutes.We're both experienced VR gamers, and it's been years since a VR game made me this nauseous.There's something quite off, maybe some latency issues or excessive smoothing when moving around.The smooth turning is especially bad, and I don't know why, but I do know Phasmophobia has the same issue, while VRChat does not. In VRChat I can run, jump and spin around all day without feeling sick. But just a few seconds of smooth turning in this game makes me feel bad.Also, hand movements aren't sync up in multiplayer, so you can't really point and gesture.. :(We played for a bit in desktop mode but it just wasn't the same, and felt so limited when interacting with things.The puzzles were quite fun though!I'll definitely return to this, and adjust my review if a future update fixes things!",negative
Escape Simulator,"As a single player experience, this fell a bit flat for me.  The puzzles are well designed, and I can see how it might work well in coop.  The lack of a story was the killer in single player though.As a seasoned adventure gamer, I come to adventure/puzzle games for a combination of a great story, interesting characters, well designed puzzles, and a sense of place/atmosphere.  This isn't strictly an adventure game, but it plays like one.  Most of the time I spent playing this, I was thinking about how I could be experiencing similar gameplay if I switched to a true adventure game, but with the motivation of an engaging story backing it.The devs have done a great job with what they set out to do, and the community rooms feature is great.

Escape Simulator,"Enjoyable in the first hour, after that the escape rooms all seem to follow a pattern, format of each room becomes very similar and it loses a lot of its appeal as an escape room, as it's less about solving and more looking for the pattern.

So, you waste too much time trying to figure out these clues before learning they are just there for.... decor? To throw you off?

Escape Simulator,"Product refundedThis game is *probably* tons of fun, if it worked. I tried playing with two other friends, but the game had bugs that soft locked us. We had to restart the first map 3 times because items could not be picked up after being dropped. We eventually powered through, but on the second map you have to drag the jars around to put them in the correct location, but then suddenly instead of dragging them they got picked up and placed in our inventories and could no longer be dropped, soft locking us again. It kept happening after restarting. We ended up all refunding the game.I'll also add that I don't know why the default visual settings are designed the way they are, but they seem scientifically crafted to give motion sickness. The game thankfully has a setting for reducing motion sickness, but the mouse acceleration setting is the greatest culprit. I've never experienced motion sickness in a game like that before so I'm seriously wondering what the devs were thinking.",negative

Escape Simulator,"Fine but having to pay for DLCs sucks. You can't really replay this game because once you've played through the levels, you already know how they're solved so very limited playtime and not worth paying extra for. If anything just get the base game and do community rooms after.",negative
Escape Simulator,"i would really like to say it's worth it, but after you burn through the dev created puzzles (which are actually pretty good), you're left with community builds. That wouldn't be a problem if the community was actually good at making puzzles. The majority don't leave good enough clues, such as placing a question mark on a wall and expecting you to solve it from just that. I'd love to see more dev builds, but relying on a community that half-asses it just kinda ruins the experience for me.",negative
Escape Simulator,"It's solid fun and overall is a good platform for escape rooms made by the general populous. The rooms are creative and overall a lot of fun. That being said. The floors aren't tangible enough, things you need for puzzles are constantly falling through them, the props are severely lacking and any additional props added are hidden behind DLC paywalls. It's so close to being a good game but it's holding itself back.This is mostly an on the fence post, because it's a good experience, fun with friends, but the devs don't really feel here. or at least there is more they could be doing.",negative
Escape Simulator,"There are a lot of abstract concepts with no clues as to where or how you are supposed to go about the puzzles. I am talking about the ones that came with the game not user created ones. It seems like they just threw things together just to release a game. On top of that, there are mechanics that just stop working or the answer doesn't work. I let someone else play and when they got stuck for a long period of time, I game them the answer and it did not work. We restarted the game and next time it work first try. This has happened multiple times. Only get this game if its 50% off.",negative
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"Imagine you're working in a 9-5 corporate job, you're done with your work, you come back home, log onto Steam, see your games list for 5 seconds, buy a game on sale that you're never going to play and then switch off your PC and go to a bar.

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"UPDATE: This remains to be one of the best games I have ever played. The company that created the game though... One more launcher that is completely unnecessary. The performance with the 'next-gen' update is horrible. I have half the fps I used to have on the very same rig and that is after going lower with the settings that I used to have. Why did you have to do this b U Ll $I t?The best way to embrace the true greatness of this game is to look on how the series has improved since the first and the second part of The Witcher. You simply won't find anything that hasn't changed for the better.- Vast open world that IS NOT randomly created and filled with dull stuff,- Story which engages you from the first 10 minutes to the very end,- Graphics, even despite the whole controversy of a thing called downgrade, still makes this game THE BEST LOOKING RPG ever created,- Soundtrack, it finally goes back to the style presented originally in The Witcher 1, something that makes you forget that's just the video game, it gives you the feeling you are in there, in some village, city or that you are fighting with someone / something, which turns every single battle into an unforgettable memory,- Every single side quest, and believe me, there is A LOT of them, is actually a little story that keeps you playing with the same force as the main quests - I call it - a new quality in RPGs,- Choices and their impact on the story - even a small choice that seems insignificant at the time can wage on the whole world around you,- THIS GAME IS MATURE, finally a game dealing with a lot of subjects which are usually handled very childishly or not at all,- Combat - nothing more to add, it's decent, though it's nothing to be praised really, you won't be able to mash buttons and win - you have to dodge, use signs, and on higher difficulties get yourself ready to have an oil for a specific enemy and a bomb to be able to put an end to his or her misery.The Witcher 3 is not a game without its flaws, although nothing that can't be fixed - some balance issues, economy basically showing Geralt as a very wealthy person (who he should not be), small performance problems like stuttering in Novigrad and in my opinion very limited after the end content (fixed by the expansions). Many of the things I struggled with have been already fixed and there is no need to disclose them.All in all, one of the best games in the last few years (even a decade).",positive

Where else do you get so much game content for your money?Of course, the game has some small weaknesses and bugs, but considering what you get in the Game of the Year Edition for a price of only 14,99 â¬ (during the Holiday Sales for example) is simply amazing.You really have to play this game, but make sure to install the ""The Witcher 3 HD Reworked Project"" mod (can be found on Nexus Mods) as well. It makes the game look even better while not asking for too much more performance from your PC.I am not a big RPG fan, nor do I like writing reviews on Steam, but this game is a solid 9,8/10!Edit:It took me 168.5 hours and about 4 weeks to complete the game with both the big DLCs.

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"Undecided for two years; whether to try the game or not. I ended up buying it on the last sale for 20â¬, the GOTY edition, and I fired it up a few weeks ago after finding myself bored one night.This game is probably the best game I've ever played. Everything, from the soundtrack to the story line, is spectacular.Making a quick resumÃ© of the things that made me fall in love with this unique gem:-The graphics are insanely good, even more so with mods. The lightning is what every game's lightning strives to be.-The voice-work of the game. I am amazed at the amount of quality work put into this game; I heard over ten thousand lines, and not a single one of them seemed bad acted, at the contrary, *every single one* was stelar. Never broke the suspension of disbelief!-The choices. The choices matter, you forge your path. Sure, you might be a witcher, and in the canon sure as hell Geralt wouldn't send an innocent man to jail just because he's a tad bit racist, but â¥â¥â¥â¥ it, you're in control here, chief!-The feelings. I normally have a hard time immersing myself in stories, and they usually don't make me feel at all, but this game was totally different. I've smiled, I've laughed, and I almost cried too. The characters are so well acted and feel so real that you ought to *feel* it.-The soundtrack! I never thought, in my entire life, that I'd end up with polish folkloric music on my library, and look at me! It really grows on you.-GWENT. Either you LOVE it, or you hate it. I personally loved every second of it, and I enjoyed collecting cards so much! Kid is in danger? â¥â¥â¥â¥ it, let's play gwent.-How even though the game is long, it doesn't feel long. Before playing this game, I was afraid that I'd feel obligated to pour dozens of hours of my life, countless days into it, without it really being that entertaining. NOPE. I've been entertained, every single one of my hours. Never got bored.-Uma.Honestly, if you're on the verge, and don't know if you might not like it, give it a shot. You might regret not getting it sooner, like I did.Not only the best game of the year, but also the best game I've ever played. I'll buy CD Projekt's next game in a heartbeat.70 hours to complete the main line, and I'm going to start the DLCs tomorrow!EDIT: Just completed the DLCs and loads of side quests at exactly 100 hours.I stand by my words, this is the best game I've ever played. I'm finsihed with it, but I'll probably replay this masterpiece in the future.I feel empty after completing this game. I know no game shall come close to this, and I know my adventures as Geralt are over. It saddens me.",positive

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"Just finished my second playthrough and I still want more!  I bought this game over a year ago and didn't get around to playing it until recently.  I added the DLC's and all additional content which I must say was well worth the money, especially if you use the content pass that is offered.I'm not a young man, almost 50 years old and I've been gaming since I was 14 years old on the Spectrum.  I've played good games and bad and in recent times have become rather annoyed at publishers that promote unfinished or badly flawed games on release, this however is not one of those products.  In fact, after i completed the game for the second time, I went to CD Projekt Red's web site to see what else they had on offer because if they produce quality like this then i'll gladly buy into their world.The Witcher 3 is, to my mind, THE best game I have ever played.  Why?  Because, from the outset, even though I hadn't played Witcher 1 or 2, the main character was easy to understand and identify with.  The general gameplay is smooth and logical in addition to the gentle learning curve.  The plot, for someone that dives strait in to Witcher 3 is relatively easy to grasp, so much so that you quickly begin to feel part of it all.The scariest thing is that it's a real emotional roller coaster, after a short while playing, you really begin to empathise with the characters, you'll be laughing out loud, feeling sad, angry and elated.I could go on but suffice to say, it's Brilliant.  Other publishers take note!  Well done ""CD Projekt Red"".",positive
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"'There's nothing behind me. I'm a Witcher, I'd have heard it. Just like I can hear your heart. Which is pounding... like a liar's.'Geralt of Rivia__________________________________________Introduction'The Witcher III: Wild Huntâ has won so many awards and has been praised by so many people that itâs kind of impossible to miss or ignore this game. Itâs the third part in the videogame series based on the books by Andrzej Sapkowski and represents the end of the famous videogame trilogy of Geralt of Rivia, a.k.a the White Wolf or the Butcher of Blaviken. To cut a long story short: The game lived up to every expectation I had and exceeded them with ease. Even the gamesâ minigames are better than many full-price titles â yeah exactly, Iâm talking about you Gwent, you awful little drug that I canât get enough ofâ¦The main story connects to the events of the second Witcher game 'Assassins of Kingsâ and brings the overall story started in the first part to an end. Witchers are infamous monster hunters, magically improved mutants that are simultanesously feared and needed in a world threatened by dark creatures, evil spirits and living nightmares. Geralt of Rivia is a famous specimen of this kind and thought for a long time that his former friend and love, the sorceress Yennefer of Vengerberg, was already dead. However during the recent events in Loc Muinne he learned that this was not the entire truth and so he decides to start a new journey to finally find answers to his questions.A huge world with fascinating lore and characters awaits the White Wolf - the sheer quantity of places you can visit, persons you can talk to and monsters that have to be slain would be enough to  fit in several other games.This world is not only packed with interesting stories, dialogues, quests, fearsome monsters and an insane amount of details behind every corner, moreover it is convincing and far away from all the happy fantasy clichÃ©s you've already seen a hundred times. There is neither black nor white, just many shades of grey. Elves are neither the glorious archers nor the kind tree people, humans not the friendly guys that accept every race the same and dwarfes are no gentle stone-loving miners. In this world you have to make choices that you wonât like and to live with the consequences. Morally ambiguous is the description youâre looking for.__________________________________________Graphics and AudioRegarding the technical aspects this game conquers Mount Olympus easily (despite the much complained 'technical downgradeâ) as it is one of the most beautiful RPGs Iâve ever seen, with amazing sunsets/sunrises, spooky nights and gorgeous views over detailled landscapes full of nature and terror - this game is definitely gorgeous.You want to see some examples? Let me show you some screenshots taken from the game using Reshade/E3FX and the free camera from the console:A lonely White Wolf in a moonlit nightA Screenshot of The Witcher 3: Wild HuntBy:#NVThe Witcher 3: Wild HuntA Screenshot of The Witcher 3: Wild HuntBy:SermikeSunset above Tor Gvalch'caA Screenshot of The Witcher 3: Wild HuntBy:#NVIn addition to the stunning visuals there is also brilliant music and fantastic voice acting that will catch you during dialogues or pumps you up during the fights. Together with the exquisite characters, the superb dialogues and all the deep little stories the game suceeds even more in creating a credible fantasy world.__________________________________________ConsSo now there's the question: Are there negative points at all?Yeah some minor flaws: Talking to every person and looting every stash is kind of unsatisfying as there is no wide variety of things that you may accomplish or find this way, so after some time you will visit mostly the important places and persons while ignoring the rest. Furthermore if everything else may be a 10/10 for me, the fighting mechanic is not as fantastic as the rest. It has definitely improved since the second part but itâs still somewhat 'special' as it lacks unique aspects, a good feedback for the hits and suffers every now and then from targeting problems, camera angles, weird controls or some questionable hitboxes.That now may sound worse than it actually is - from my point of view it's 'still' an 8 out of 10. In addition I encountered some small visual glitches and sound errors during cutscenes but they were so small and disappeared after reloading, so I donât even care about this at all. Compared to the gamesâ size and content there are nearly no problems at all and everything runs more than just smoothly for me.To be honest there is only only real downside that I have with the game: My journey with Geralt will end some day and it set new standards regarding characters, lore and dialogues that future RPGs have to be compared with - and this will be a tough struggle for many of them.__________________________________________ConclusionSo in the end, would I recommend the game? Yes â and no.Itâs a fantastic RPG with an amazing amount of content, exquisite characters, dialogues and interesting stories, so Iâd recommend it for everyone who has even the slightest positive attitude towards RPGs or the fantasy genre in general.However at the same time I wouldnât recommend the game for anyone who has only little time to spare, doesnât want to be immersed in a massive world full of lore or just wants to rush the story - this game needs time. A lot of time. However it pays off by providing a brilliant experience that will take you on a journey that youâll never regret or forget...â¦or to be more precise let's call it 'a journey youâd like to forget'. Just to experience this masterpiece again from the start and to get these great feelings again (damn I even ignored the fast-travel option and turned off the minimap and the quest hints willingly for many hours (Iâve been lost so many times) to enjoy the world and the quests even longer).I rate it gladly 9.5 out of 10 points.__________________________________________Let's end this review with another badass quote of the White Wolf:'I'm a Witcher. Heard you wondering about my swords. Well, one's for monsters, the other for humans.'",positive

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"This game is more than another blockbuster title; it's one of those that defined a chapter in my life.I played Witcher 1 when it was released in 2007, back when I was a single man working in my first job few years out of college. I even remember playing it through one of the worst years of my life. 2011 came, Witcher 2 was released and I immediately bought the box set with the soundtrack, coin, and map. A lot of things changed in my life by then and I took on a whole new adventure in career, travel, and even love. Then after many years, Witcher 3.After finishing Blood and Wine, the final expansion, I uninstalled and finally closed this magnificent story that has been a part of me for the last nine years.Now as my wife and I take on a new adventure into parenthood, I know that I won't have time to finish long RPGs anymore so this may be my last hurrah. That being said, this game, its story, characters, lore, will remain with me moving forward, defining what story and videogames can and should be.Goodbye and see you Witcher. Salute.",positive
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"After so many hours, so many adventures, so many life lessons.. I wish I had words to describe this game, but I simply don't.It is definately the best game I've ever played in my life, it's like a work of art that I'm glad I had the chance to experience.Every place you go feels so alive, the characters are so well written that most of the time I would get completely immersed into the conversations with them.When you look back at it after doing everything, every single quest, all the expansions, all the places.. You feel something like a good memory from the past, a feeling of nostalgia..When people say this game is big, it's kinda hard to understand what it means, for some, it's the map, or the number of quests, or even the size of the campaign, but I believe this game is big on what it tried to achieve, on the greatness of the story that it told, the powerful effects of your choices, the felling you have when you discover a new monster and quickly have to adapt to overcome it, the experience you have when picking up a trail, or sailing through the cold oceans of skellige alone..So many memories, that with words it's simply too hard to explain, memories that I will always hold dear to my heart.Thanks CD PROJEKT, simply, thanks.",positive
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,I Started a quest. ended up with no reward and a child with a dead family. escorted her to her relatives in nearby village. they had no coin to take in an extra mouth. paid coin out of my pocket to take care of her. actually ended up with less than when i had at the start of the quest. But i have never been more satisfied.No game can compare to this masterpiece. Quest aren't just go here and kill this. They are beautiful story's that are so memorable.,positive

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"Imagine you're working in a 9-5 corporate job, you're done with your work, you come back home, log onto Steam, see your games list for 5 seconds, buy a game on sale that you're never going to play and then switch off your PC and go to a bar. While having a drink, you think of the good times when games used to be fun and authentic. But then you tell yourself, the problem isn't the games, its you. ""Its not that games aren't fun anymore, you have gotten older"".And then I play Witcher 3. And suddenly I can't wait to get myself home after work. Do you have any idea how precious that feeling is ? The feeling that you are actually immersed in the protagonist' shoes. I find myself in anticipation and excitement for the new adventures that are waiting for me, I think while driving back home....""Where is this story headed ? What new places and characters I will meet ?"" And lets not talk about the characters. I thought myself as a guy who's dead on the inside and somehow these characters made me laugh, chuckle and empathise at the same time. I haven't felt these feelings for a game since 2008 when I played games such as Final Fantasy 12, Metal Gear Solid 3. Was I wrong to think that I was the problem and not the gaming industry that's shelling out mediocre AAA games with no memorable characters or storyline ?And I got this game for 3$. 3$ !! And that includes the DLC ! I honestly feel I looted these amazing devs. And I paid twice for games that are not even worth playing. The side quests are actually fun. I find myself doing the side quests more because its feels like I am watching another episode of the ""Witcher 3 TV show"". I love this open world, I actually take my time wandering around and exploring every nook and cranny. I haven't done this since GTA San Andreas.

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"This game is the biggest mistake you can make. After playing it you will feel depressed about how bad all other games are.It's just so incredibly good, detailed to the last bit, with huge amount of content and far-reaching concequences of player choices.

Witcher contracts can be a bit repeatable, but stay complex and interesting nevertheless.It's a must-play before you die. Just be sure not to spoil yourself all other games accidentally.",positive

I really do love a good story in a movie, a book or a series though.This is one of the only RPGs I have ever played. I got so immersed into the world that at one point I had to decide to stop roaming and stop doing side quests because I was spending too much time on them (they were damn interesting). I followed the main storyline after that.When I look back at the times when I was playing The Witcher 3, the memories are very colorful and nice.

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"An introductionThe Witcher 3 is certainly a game that has been hyped since it was released, and it still is, to some degree. I am sure that you've heard a lot about how this game is so great and blah blah blah. Sure, you can believe that and try the game yourself, but today I want to give you an honest review about what makes this game so loved. Buckle up, buckaroos.A quick look at the storyAt a first glance, it seems that everybody plays this game because Geralt is so popular among the fans. He is, and with good reason. Geralt is a witcher: a monster hunter traveling the world far and wide in search of contracts on monsters only people like him can take down. He's got the full set: bombs, swords, potions that make him 10 times more badass than he already is, allies, etc. Witchers are trained to hunt monsters by passsing ""The Trial of Grasses"", a chemical procedure that injects potions into young boys to sharpen their senses, give them strength, speed, dexterity and the unforgetable cat eyes.The full lore is, of course, way deeper than this quick explanation. From The Witcher 3 is about (I reccomend playing the Witcher 2 before this or at least reading some of the books, to understand the lore better since it can be a tad bit confusing at first) Geralt's odyssey to find Ciri and Yennefer, his ""daughter"" and his lover, in a race against time to save the world from The Wild Hunt and the White Frost. Going into the story anymore than this would mean spoiling the experience for you. Once you get to play the game though, you will experience for yourself the loveable characters, develop a bond with Geralt and feel like you are actually a part of the game's world.The gameplayThe game features classic rpg elements. The gameplay is pretty straightforward: you do quests to acquire better gear and level up, rinse and repeat. Even so, the side quests are not the basic ""go there, kill that many things, come back"" type of quests. They all have their each own unique little side story which gives the game even more flavour. They are memorable and fun, unlike other rpgs these days.The main quests feature choices which leave a mark on the game's world and truly affect the story. The WItcher 3 also features treasure hunts for better gear and quests that you can actually fail, adding an overall more realistic feeling to the already complex game.The map is huge, the vanilla version featuring 4 different regions. There is plenty to do other than explore. From finding easter eggs to clearing the places of interest on the map, I can guarantee you won't have time to be bored in this game. Other systems like crafting weapons and armor to forging runes are also a major component of the game, with Witcher armor sets blueprints to find and legendary weapons to forge or collect. Every artisan in the game's world has a certain level of experience and can only forge gear up to that point. To forge better and better gear, you must find the master and eventually grandmaster (in Blood and Wine) craftsmen.The combat system and skillsThe Witcher 3 features a variety of skills and builds you can choose. Like wearing light armor and casting signs from afar? No problem! Like engaging in swordplay and slaying your enemies with graceful finishing moves? No problem! Like not even fighting? Sure thing, you can even control people's minds to do just that!The plethora of ways in which you can play this game is most welcome, since it makes the game have a very high replayability value, both from a story perspective (you can experiment with choices and try to get different endings) and a gameplay perspective (even though you can change your build on the go with a Potion of Clearence which resets your skill points).The game has quite a basic fighting system. You can get close and personal with the dual swords Geralt features (steel for men, silver for monsters) and either perform light/heavy attacks, parries and counter attacks (there are skills which expand the swordfighting with special moves and finishers) or you can fight from afar with signs like Igni, Yrden, Aard, you name it. The signs are powerful spells which can be modified by skills as well. Overall, the combat system feels great. You can also install mods (the community has plenty of them, especially on Nexus) to make the experience even better.Graphics and soundtrackThis game has absolutely beautiful graphics, which hold a place among the top even in 2017, almost 2 years and a half after its release. Everything from the grass to the monsters and rocks looks amazing! The soundtrack features masterfully composed music that fits just right in every situation, be it combat or just peacefully exploring the amazing map.The DLCThe two expansion packs, Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine feature so much content that they almost match the game time you get in the original version of the game. Hearts of Stone is a beautiful story about Olgierd von Everec, an immortal man who has been cursed with a heart of stone, whose content adds roughly 15 more hours of game time, and Blood and Wine even features a whole new region of the map to explore and complete quests in, which adds another 35 hours of game time.Hearts of Stone features a whole new crafting system called enchanting, which allows you to enchant your gear with the help of a runewright. In Blood and Wine, all crafting systems are expanded with Grandmaster craftsmen, which can forge grandmaster armor and weapons. Just like the main game, the expansion packs are also full of choices and can have different endings. If you have your mind set on buying the game, go for the GOTY version.ConclusionThis game is a masterpiece in my opinion. It satisfies all of the gamer's needs a modern rpg should satisfy, while also offering endless hours of playtime and replay value. If you are at the very least interested in rpgs, you will enjoy this and immediately fall in love with the wonderful cast of characters, making you want to play the game more and more. It also has that unique je ne sais quois that no other game can match. The current price of the game is a solid deal, guys (20$). I reccomend buying it. You won't regret!",positive

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"Positive Aspects:ð¹Stunning Visuals for a game released back in 2015, still looks brand new.ð¹Amount of content is ridiculous I needed around 65 hours ( some offline ) in order to finish only the story and just thinking about all the well made side missions etc you can easily get 200 hours out of this game.ð¹Great Story with deep characters and an amazing atmosphere.ð¹Well made Cutscenes with detailed dialogues.ð¹Great pricing at the moment.ð¹Performance is honestly pretty good for a game that looked that crazy.Negative Aspects:ð¸Although this is one of the best games I will simply mention one problem not because its bad but because its not as good as other aspects, the fighting mechanics feel a little rusty and basic but other than they do their job.Note:I honestly was never able to really stick with an RPG and I was a little sceptical starting with the Witcher back in 2017 but I really felt stupid for not giving it a chance a lot earlier, this game is truly a masterpiece.IntroductionThe Witcher 3 Wild Hunt is the third game of the series,it is a Third person open world RPG set in a medieval magical world, where you play as Geralt of Rivia, a professional Monster Hunter who is in a mission to find and protect the Child of the prophecy which at the same time is a major weapon if not controlled correctly, keep in mind that this game uses the REDengine 3 which is the main reason for these amazing visuals.The game was developed and published by CD PROJEKT RED.Release Date: 18th May 2015Gameplay:Letâs just say that this game doesn't do anything insane gameplay wise but it is obviously very good at it.Open World / Quests:Usually the main problem with Open World games is that they feel pretty repetitive and overall have the looks of a ââdeadââ world where nothing happens etc. but in The Witcher 3 you get such a unique feeling with it, NPCs talk, some of them are disgusted by your presence while others are happy to see you roam around their village, even kids have different reactions to your presence as some of them run away while others look up to you, this is a small sample size but this will be a known concept to you after a while.Now there are various activities, random moments or encounters and even some momentarily quests which make the game feel a lot more alive and social, the Map itself is enormous and it includes caves, sea and hidden areas which adds to the depth of this amazing game. Now to the Quests, despite this being an Open World game almost every mission feels different which is a huge thing compared to other open world games,we can go from Stealthy to finding mysterious relics or ghosts, fighting strong creatures with bows, head to hea combat and more, every mission just has a unique feel to them with every character to that mission playing a role. Side mission are exactly built like that as well, CD Projekt red really took their time to not just slap a half worked mission as a side mission but they actually had a reason to exist and that makes the side missions so appealing, overall the open world and mission structure by itself is just flawless.Combat:Now here we enter the only are where I didnt feel that it was that good compared to all the other aspects, fighting in this game isnât exactly bad or even mediocre but rather solid, the character ( Geralt ) himself feels pretty stiff in my opinion but at the same time he feels as agile as Ciri herself, so the characters feel a little inconsistent, the sword fighting feels strong and solid but I just didnât get to see many moves it is overall a very basic movement, and lastly barrel roll spamming felt just like Dark Souls to me and despite rolling on enemies they were not hitting me. Overall it is a great experience with some small inconsistencies.Weather, damages etc.:The Weather in The Witcher 3 is absolutely great, it is dynamic and a love it when it starts raining that the map looks a lot darker and moody as it should be, the trees physics are still top notch as well.Story:There will be no major spoilers.All the major characters from the previous 2 games will be taking part in this installment , now as mentioned above Geralt decided to find the Child of the Prophecy which is Ciri herself, why does he want to find her? In order to protect her from the Wild Hunt, in his quests to achieve all this Geralt meets old faces, some other old female faces with a lot of nudity of course of course meeting other powerful friends helped him a lot on his quests, after all this he located Ciri and they decided to fight against the Wild Hunt in the stronghold etc where they sadly won and lost at the same time, after that Geralt decides to kill the general of the Wild Hunt himself and of course succeeding in that and in a last major fight they all defeat the Wild Hunt while Ciri does her part in saving the World. Simply explained but the story is so much deeper than that.Graphics/ Audio:The Witcher 3: Wild HuntA Screenshot of The Witcher 3: Wild HuntBy:Sermikeâ§ð¦[ÌÌ²â ]ð¢â¯ðð¶âð â´ð» âð¾ðð¾ð¶[ÌÌ²â ]â§ð¦Community Created Artwork for The Witcher 3: Wild HuntBy:[â ]â§Malachiâ§[â ]""Evil is evil.

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"It's 2024, and The Witcher 3 remains the best game I've ever played. I wish I could go back and experience it for the first time.Writing this after just finishing Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut - the game is great: well-written story, enjoyable gameplay, and visually stunning, but it made me realize that in comparison, The Witcher 3 is still on another levelâa masterpiece. I've played numerous RPGs, but few come close to The Witcher 3 in terms of the overall experience, including immersion, world-building, role-playing, player choices, blend of fantasy and realism, soundtrack, and replayability. The Next-Gen update has also made the game look absolutely stunning and not at all dated. The world, especially Toussaint, is incredibly beautiful.The combat may be the weakest part of the game and can feel slightly dated, but it's definitely playable and not as bad as some people say. My favorite aspect is preparing for combatâknowing which potions or signs to use against specific types of enemies and situations.One aspect that sets The Witcher 3 apart from other games is the developers' attention to detail, which makes the world extremely immersive and story-rich. The variety in the side quests is remarkable in terms of storytelling, often blending elements encountered elsewhere. Many of these quests are even more entertaining than the main storyline. This attention extends to random world encounters; in most other games, it's simply about killing bandits or rescuing someone, but in The Witcher 3, you can become invested in random characters you meet on the road, sympathize with their stories, investigate, and make tough decisions that leave you pondering whether you made the right choice.I also appreciate that throughout the gameâwhether in main quests, side quests, or random encountersâyou have the freedom to make choices, although sometimes the wording can be misleading in certain quests. Almost every choice has impactful, sometimes far-reaching, and unexpected consequences, which enhances the world's immersion, realism, and complexity. You can play as you like, shaping Geralt as you imagine or want him to be. This freedom is something I enjoy more than RPGs where players have limited decision-making and must follow a predetermined path.If I were to rate some of the RPGs I've enjoyed (minimum 80 hours):The Witcher 3: 10/10Elden Ring: 10/10Skyrim: 9.5/10Kingdom Come: Deliverance: 9/10Cyberpunk: 8.5/10Ghost of Tsushima: 8/10Hogwarts Legacy: 8/10Assassin's Creed Origins: 7.5/10Assassin's Creed Odyssey: 7/10",positive
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"I admit I was a bit concerned over the few years that The Witcher 3 was being developed. Hearing how CD PROJEKT RED decided to go ""open-world"" and make the game 30 times larger than the previous Witcher games. These games were always more about substance for me and ""open-world"" games tend to lose some of that. I wasn't so sure it would work. Then, the game then was delayed in 2014. Wasn't a good sign for me.Soon after it was released, I picked it up. I spent the first few hours just taking in how beautiful and detailed the game world is. The water, trees, animals, grass..everything felt alive. I started playing the game and got hooked. The main questline itself was full of characters you grow to love and care about and a story that you typically don't get in a video game. The side quests in the game weren't your typical ""fetch this"" or ""Kill this"" type...all of them had a story and decisions to make on how to complete them.The combat seemed clunky at first but then you start to realize this isn't a button mashing game, patience and timing was the way to go. It can be on the easy side on the normal difficulty levels, especially when only using your sword for combat but it gets more interesting when you start to use alchemy and signs.In the end, I couldn't believe how great of a game this ended up being. The game's production values and writing are some of the best I've ever seen. Although I spent 150+ hours in my first playthrough of this game, I was bummed it was ending. Rarely do I feel like that after playing a game of this scale. It really is amazing how much CD PROJEKT RED put into this and they easily made one of the best games I've ever played.",positive

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"My 100th steam review!I have wanted to playThe Witcher 3: Wild Huntsince its release in 2015; however, I was always hesitant to start because I knew that I would not be able to stop. It only took a few hours of gameplay for The Witcher 3 to turn into my newly discovered obsession. I found myself waking up early on weekends to get an early start. âIâll only finish one quest tonightâ often extended to two or three, and I starting doing something that I usually never do: replaying quests to try different options. 110 hours later(#noragrets), and Iâm finally ready to put my controller down. What an experience. Never has a single-player game kept me interested for so long, which speaks volumes about how immersive this game truly is. CD Projekt Red set a very high standard for Triple A games and a strong reputation for themselves.By far my favorite gaming experience of 2019.Played with Playstation 4 controllerPositive:For a game that is 4+ years old, the Witcher 3 really looks amazing. From thestrands of Geraltâs hair, to the different landscapes and cities(I especially loved Toussaint),to the weather/lighting, you can really tell that a lot of time was spent to make this game feel as alive as possible. I have never seen a game do the sunspots in your vision as well as this game has managed.The biggest selling points, in my opinion, are the characters and story telling. Without the magnificent writing and voice acting offered, the Witcher 3 would not have been such an immersive experience. Given how many characters are introduced in the series, itâs amazing how many unique personalities there are. Literally none of the main characters are repetitive, dull, or lack personality. There are countless quests and wonderful moments that I remember vividly and am very fond of, for example, whenI received a drawing from a little girl I saved.More impressively so, you even feel a part of the game while in the overworld. Many NPCs will interact with you as you as you walk by. Depending on the city and progression of the game, they will either call you names, spit at you, or praise and greet you. I especially liked that cats hiss at you (Witchers are mutants of sorts and animals dislike that).Although this may sound contradictory, it is also great that you are allowed to skip dialogue. This is perfect for those who donât care about the story, but in my case it makes replaying quests (to choose different options) a more pleasant experience, since I donât have to wait through long cutscenes that I have already seen.There isSOmuch content. Even in the base game alone (which took me approximately 75 hours to play through), the world is so vast, full of quests, treasure hunts, contracts, and even fun easter eggs. The Skellege isles alone has over 20 islands that you can explore individually. My favorite discovery by far is when I founddead Tyrionlocked up in a cell. To my surprise, I even enjoyed playing Gwent, the card game introduced as a mini-game. Initially I ignored Gwent as a whole, but once I learned how to play it, it quickly became an addiction. I remember spending two full weekends roaming around only to play Gwent and collect new cards. The fact that CD Projekt Red chose to release Gwent as a separate game really goes to show how successful it is.I absolutely love that the DLCs introduced (Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine) are fully worth their price. Both DLCs add more than 20 hours of gameplay just through the main quest lines alone, but even more if you want to delve deeply into each (highly recommend to do so). I donât want to give away too much, but both main quests are spectacularly written. New monsters and quests are introduced, and in the case of Blood and Wine, a whole new area, new upgrades (both to your character and weapons), and the opportunity to have your own villa are added. Not to sound too biased but some of myfavoritequestsare included in Blood and Wine. It is also a nice touch that the developers included a feature which allows you to start the game directly at the DLC (start at level 30 with average equipment) but honestly I would recommend playing through the main game first, as it will make the DLCs that much more special.Neutral:Note: Given the ginormous amount of content the Witcher 3 offers, it is easy to nit-pick things that donât work perfectly. Unfortunately I could not include these in the review (due to the character limit) but want to stress that there was nothing I particularly hated and that the âPositiveâ points heavily outweigh the âNeutralâ ones.The combat system is fantastically complex. You have access to your swords, signs (magic) and skill trees but in reality, information is your greatest weapon. Every monster has a different weakness which can be exploited in the form of oils (for your swords), bombs, potions, and signs. Reading and applying information from the bestiary weighs heavily in your favor. Ignoring it kind of defeats the purpose of the game, since you are a monsters-specialist (witcher) after all. While I do love the whole combat system, there are also some downsides to it, namely, having to look through the bestiary and inventory during combat. Having to apply oils and equip the correct bombs and potions really breaks the flow of combat. The number of potions and bombs you have available can also be overwhelming, despite their useful effects. As a result, I ended up only using a handful of potions and bombs mainly because I was too lazy to manage my inventory often. Furthermore, the combat does not have the best difficulty curve. I personally felt that the game started off quite difficult, perhaps in part due to the steep learning curve and the lack of decent equipment (or money to buy anything decent). However, once I completed a few contracts, earned some money and found decent equipment, the difficulty dropped significantly. Thankfully there are some features included that allow you to ramp up the difficulty: turning enemy scaling on and/or increasing the base difficulty. Both DLCs also bump up the game difficulty significantly, so the end-game is still delightfully challenging. The final boss of Blood and Winewas monstrous.Conclusion:âââââ ExceptionalThe Witcher 3 is a hell of an experience that will remain deeply engraved in my memory. I mean there arenât many games out there that allow you to have sex on top of a taxidermied unicorn. I also cannot stress enough how much this game offers for a single-player experience - I could easily spend another delightful 30-50 hours on my current save file without replaying quests or starting a new game (+). Highly recommended!This game is a steal at full price,and even more so when itâs on sale! What are you waiting for?If you enjoyed this review please give it a thumbs up and follow me on mycurator page. Thank you for your support!",positive
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"This is the greatest game ive ever played in my life (ive been gaming since Pong/2600). My time played is bordering on embarassing, and its going to get worse with BaW just released. This is my comfort game, whenever I am bored of another game, I can always come back to this one. I also played through W1 and W2 multiple times (not on Steam) so I was foaming at the mouth for years, waiting for this game.I'm the kind of gamer where I need more than just a story, I want a great story, great loot/crafting/item management, great combat, and great character RPG skill building. This game has it all, and its completely adjustable. Only want the story and swinging your sword at monsters but dont want to get into crafting/alchemy/skills? Just play it on the easiest and you can skip all of that, and just watch the story (Naughty dog/telltale style). You want to get hardcore and make all the crafting/oils/bombs/potions/thought into char build usefull? Turn it on Death march and make all your desisions count and make all the battles extremely fun and tacticle. 4 of my 5 playthroughs are on DM and it is the true Witcher 3 experience.Games with great stories alone just dont cut it for me anymore. A good example of this recently was Uncharted 4, dont get me wrong it had a great story, but after the Witcher I was bored to tears and still havent finished it. In that game you do nothing but shoot at stuff and watch the story, which is fine for some people but not me. In Witcher 3 you get a GOT quality of a story, including voice acting, animation, ect. However when you want to take a break from that, visit one of the equally engaging side stories and monster hunts, go on scavenger hunts for treasure and 6 different sets specialized witcher gear, 4 of which have 5 tiers of upgrades. Go visit question marks on the map for more side stories and treasures, hunt down rare ingredients for your potions/bombs/oils. Theres all of that and I havent even talked about Gwent yet....  You will also be collecting cards rare and common through out the game world for an entire card game built from the ground up as a mini game within this game. The game is so â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ good that they are now releasing it as a full game because everyone went â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ nuts for it. Ive played so much Gwent that I know what the computer is going to do before they even do it.I could go on and on, but bottom line.......this game has set a new mark in all the gaming industry for other compaines to aspire to. CDPR for â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ life.Pros:Everything, it has it all. This is the equivelent of gaming super crack- Great char building and skill trees, even better now with BaW DLC- A very well done and responsive battle system that gets even more fun and tacticle as you turn up the difficulty. The only *sword fight simulator* that is better is Dark Souls.- Tons of weapons, armor, and crafting, including all the Witcher specialized sets that change their look with each upgrade.- One of the greatest game stories ive ever seen, which may have only been topped by its own DLC in Hearts of Stone. Top notch voice acting, animation, and choice/dialog system.- â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Gwent- A vast living, breathing open world only rivaled by GTAVs open world for scope and detail.- Details, details, details, a huge amount of love and time were poured into this game. I spend hours just looking at stuff and admiring all the little things.  (see hours played)Cons:It will ruin all other games for you. Everything else is now harder to get in to because of this. So, you know.......be careful",positive
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"Truly a masterpiece!I started playing this game with my first play through on April of 2018, spent a lot of hours on it but i couldn't finish it due to real life matters. I decided that i should finish what i couldn't finish, and so on my second play through i went back from the very start and played it fresh, as if i had forgotten everything. After spending lots and lots of hours i finally finished the base game of The Witcher 3 on February 2020 then all of the DLC's on March 2020 and it was one hell of a ride! Played all of them from The Witcher 1, 2, and 3 everything was well connected and the story build up was amazing! seeing familiar faces to seeing new ones, truly made you feel like you were living Geralt's life. I've played this game for quite a long time already and it felt like it was time for me to give this masterpiece the review that it deserved.This game will always have a place in my heart. Thank you for the amazing trilogy CDprojektRed!",positive

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"I've been a gamer most of my life, starting with my first Atari 2600 in the early 1980's. This is the greatest RPG I've ever played. I've used Steam for many years now, and never written a review for a game before...this game was good enough to make me feel like I should.Looking back on it, I feel like I actually played several games. The overall storyline contained so many sub-plots that each ""chapter"" felt like its own complete game. I've heard some people mention this as a negative, but I can't possibly see how. It's value...you don't have to play the game if you don't want to. If you only want 40 hours of content from a AAA title, then quit playing it after 40 hours.As for the quests themselves, I found even the random mini-quests generated from ""undiscovered locations"" to be well-executed and thoughtful, some of which would only take a few minutes to complete, but added genuine character to the gaming world, making it feel like a real place. After over 170 hours of play, I found myself saving the final quest and just roaming around Skellige checking out undiscovered locations, even though I knew the vast majority of them were smugglers caches, and I already had all the gear and crowns I could ever use...I didn't want it to end. I anxiously await the next DLC expansion.I hear a lot of people complain about the combat system as well, and for the life of me I can't understand why. In close quarters the camera gets a bit wonky, and it's hard to maneuver properly because of your view being obstructed, but that's only in a few specific places. The combat system is elegant in that it is as complex as you make it. You can finish the game quite easily doing nothing but blocking/countering if your opponent is human, dodge/attack if your opponent is a monster. Now add to this basic and extremely effective routine the use of the various bombs, potions, decoctions, and signs, especially in conjunction with area effects and each other...there are a thousand ways to defeat your opponents. Throwing a gas bomb and lighting up a bunch of bandits with Igni is always entertaining, as is using Axii to make a guy kill his buddy. Some special attacks you can unlock, like Whirl, are just amazing to watch when you pull it off correctly to take out a whole group of enemies in one fantastic display of swordsmanship.Gwent is another feature that gets a lot of attention, and I really didn't know what to make of it at first. After analyzing it for a little while, and picking up some different cards with different abilities, I began to realize the genius of it, and eventually got to the point where I can honestly say I haven't had as much fun with an RPG mini-game since Triple Triad in FF8. It's just another part of this game that is absolutely brilliant in its simplicity yet astoundingly deep.Well, there you go. My first Steam review. I enjoyed this game immensely, and unless you're a cave troll, you probably will too.",positive
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"Redefining the RPG Genre: An Epic Spellbinding Fantasyâ¦TL;DRÂ» As we enter 2023, The Witcher 3 is an experience that should not be missed and is undeniably one of the greatest games ever made. Even years after its release, the graphics still hold up remarkably well, and with the combination of its stunningly detailed environments, notable characters, and excellent story, this game continues to stand the test of time. If you have not added it to your Steam library yet, Istrongly recommenddoing so, especially for just $15 during the summer sale. Trust me, the value you will receive from this extraordinary game far exceeds its price.Â»The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, without a doubt, deserves its place as one of the best RPG titles to have ever graced the gaming world. From its expansive open world to its legendary storytelling and outstanding gameplay, this game sets the bar impossibly high for what an RPG can achieve.EnvironmentÂ» Letâs begin with the world â a sprawling, living, and breathing wonder. Drawing its inspirations from Slavic mythology and taking place in what is known as the Continent, The Witcher 3 offers players a wide variety of environments to explore. Majestic mountains pierce the sky, their snow-capped peaks reaching toward the heavens. Dense forests, teeming with life and secrets, create an atmosphere of mystery and intrigue. War-torn villages in Velen bear the scars of conflict, their buildings, and inhabitants reflecting the hardships endured in a troubled world. Novigrad, a bustling city-state, pulsates with life and presents players with a vibrant urban landscape to navigate. Skellige, an archipelago of rugged islands, offers a breathtaking maritime setting with its own distinct culture and challenges. Finally, Toussaint in the Blood and Wine expansion presents players with a picturesque land of rolling hills, vineyards, and chivalric traditions. Every location within The Witcher 3 exudes a sense of realism and detail that is unmatched, making the world feel alive and tangible.Â» Exploring this vast map is an adventure in itself, as players stumble upon hidden treasures, encounter fantastical creatures, and uncover unexpected stories. From the thriving towns to the remote and untamed wilderness, every corner of the environment offers a unique experience, inviting players to venture off the beaten path and discover the wonders and dangers that await.CharactersÂ» Central to this immersive world is Geralt of Rivia, the iconic protagonist and a character with immense depth. As a Witcher, a monster hunter with supernatural abilities, Geraltâs journey is an emotional rollercoaster filled with tough choices and moral dilemmas. Just like its predecessors, the voice acting and dialogues in The Witcher 3 bring Geralt to life, creating a believable and compelling hero whose struggles and achievements resonate with players on a profound level.Â» The supporting cast, including Geraltâs allies, friends, and even foes, are also some of the most memorable and well-developed individuals, making them feel like real people with their own ambitions, fears, and desires. The return of existing characters such as Triss, Yennefer, Ciri, and Dandelion are utilized brilliantly from the source material, as they integrate themselves into the overall storyline from previous titles. Players are able to create meaningful connections and interact with these characters, and the relationships you forge and the choices you make have consequences that ripple throughout the game, leaving a lasting impact on both the narrative and the world around you.Â» Apart from the main characters, the Witcher 3âs world is populated by a vast array of unique and engaging individuals. From kings and queens to peasants and merchants, every NPC feels distinct and contributes to the rich tapestry of the gameâs universe. The attention to detail is further evident in the smaller interactions and conversations, which often provide glimpses into their lives, histories, and perspectives.Main StoryÂ» As for the narrative, brace yourself for a storytelling experience that is nothing short of epic. The Witcher 3 weaves together a tale of political intrigue, personal vendettas, and existential threats in a way that keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the entire journey. The main quest is engrossing and emotionally charged, filled with unexpected twists and turns that leave you questioning your own decisions and allegiances.Â» But it is the gameâs myriad of side quests and contracts that truly showcase its storytelling prowess. Each side quest feels like a mini adventure, with its own unique characters and narratives that often rival the main storyline in terms of quality and depth. This is backed by writing that is top-notch, tackling mature themes with nuance and never shying away from the complexities of the human condition.DLCsÂ» After the initial questline, the Witcher 3 also includes two major expansions, offering a substantial amount of additional gameplay, quests, and memorable experiences. Without going into too much detail,Hearts of Stone, the first expansion, takes players on a dark and twisted adventure in a new region, where Geralt encounters a mysterious individual, leading him into a web of deceit and supernatural occurrences.Â» On the other hand,Blood and Wine, the second expansion, takes players to a duchy, in a more picturesque region. This time Geralt finds himself embroiled in a dark secret plaguing the land, unraveling a thrilling vampire-hunting adventure. Both of these remarkable expansions not only provide new locations and quests but also enrich the world of The Witcher 3, effortlessly merging into the core experience and giving players a chance to delve deeper into the lore.GameplayÂ» Last, but certainly not least, regarding the gameplay itself, The Witcher 3 strikes a perfect balance between action and role-playing elements. The combat system, although a bit wonky at times, is smooth for the most part and requires strategic thinking, swordplay, and the use of Geraltâs magical signs. Engaging in battles with monstrous creatures and human foes proves to be a thrilling experience, requiring precise timing, tactics, and clever utilization of Geraltâs abilities. This makes the combat deep yet accessible, offering a satisfying challenge that rewards both skillful reflexes and thoughtful planning.Â» Beyond combat, the game is brimming with activities and diversions. From crafting and alchemy, horseback races, to even Gwent, a card game that has become a phenomenon in its own right. The sheer amount of content and things to do is staggering, ensuring countless hours of entertainment without ever feeling repetitive or overwhelming.ConclusionÂ» Overall, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt transcends the boundaries of its genre. Its rich, immersive world, combined with a cast of unforgettable characters, compelling storytelling, and refined gameplay are what make it a modern-day masterpiece. Special thanks to the developers over atCD Projekt Red, who have created a true work of art that will be celebrated and cherished by RPG enthusiasts like me for many years to come.Score: 9.6/10Was this review helpful?Â» If so, please leave a rating.

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"Its hard to try and summarise a game that has so much depth, because it truly deserves more then just a review for recognition. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt has got to be the greatest single player game I've ever experienced.With so many areas to talk about, I'll first mention about game dialogue. Considering an average novel is between 80,000 and 100,000 words, the script to Witcher 3 accumulates to a 450,000 word goliath. Unbelievable. It required over 950 speaking roles, which reportedly took more than two and a half years to successfully accomplish. What's slightly more incredible then those statistics, is that Witcher 3 makes you feel like you don't want to skip any of it whatsoever, through an amalgamation of whit, thrill, mystery, passion and more. I've never known a game to deliver dialogue so well, but on top of that it's you that gets the choice to control the narrative. You can continue to showcase Geralt as the renowned warrior he is, or you can often show his softer side in certain situations. Another wonderful feat to the game is that co-developer Marcin Iwinski announced that there are 36 possible endings to finish the story - because why not? A truly staggering achievement.The environment & world to Witcher 3 is out of this world. To put it into perspective, the map is 20% larger than Skyrim. It's also 35 times larger than the map found in Witcher 2. A large map is a good feat on its own, but these stats give CD Projekt Red huge bragging rights. The vast differences in land, regions and towns makes the world so alive and unique, countless and endless ways to enjoy and immerse yourself in a variety of different ways - even just site seeing.You get to see a lot of the world through the storyline, but stepping away from that and doing side quests & contracts is where you can find yourself in extraordinary circumstances. I can't honestly tell you another game that's genuinely made me want to do everything. Each side quest feels like a mini-storyline, you don't seem to get any that follow a tedious or repetitive nature. On one side of the spectrum you could be fighting the biggest and deadliest creatures that Velen and Skellige have to offer, then on the other side you'll be hunting treasure and solving riddles, balls deep in Nekker swamps.You'll more then likely reach a few points in the game where you are overburdened with side quests, treasure hunts and contracts. It can sometimes lead to confusion, but the easiest way to clear your Journal is to simply focus and go through each section at a time. I tended to stick to one area and do everything I could before moving on to the next. Obviously due to level restrictions, some of them cannot be completed until Geralt is stronger - which doesn't mean you can't try to do them, it just means that it could be increasingly difficult in doing so. One moment that I will always remember is when I went to fight a Royal Griffin that was 12 levels higher than me. I would spend a long time evading damage and trying to deliver some form of pain, but its almost like the Griffin was laughing at me, all I seemed to do was shave feathers off its back, nothing more. Then in one foul swoop, I'd be dead. Repeat. Dead. Repeat. Dead. â¥â¥â¥â¥. I'm one that embraces difficulty, playing on the hardest setting in this game is fantastic, yet this was a battle that I had to swallow my pride and leave. Go away. Get stronger. Come back, and rip that â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ bird to pieces. This was great, not many times have I been in a situation where a game would allow me to fight a much higher level, you tend to get games match the enemies strength based on your current level. With this said, I actually much preferred Witcher 3's approach, it created some great and memorable fight scenes where I wouldn't necessarily assume victory. Certain areas are swamped with much higher creatures early on, so returning to them 50+ hours later provided a nice feeling of self accomplishment and power.Now I remember all those years ago, playing cards in a big Saloon in Red Dead Redemption. Poker, Blackjack, maybe a little bit of Five Finger Fillet or Liar's Dice. These were wonderful times. Now I have a new love, playing Gwent. Gwent is a collectable card game that simulates two armies meeting on the battlefield. ""Invented by dwarves and perfected over centuries of tavern table play, Gwent is a game of initial simplicity and ultimate depth, something beloved by both road-weary travellers during long nights around the campfire and elegant nobles looking to liven up dragging dinner parties."" I have no idea how much time I've spent playing Gwent in this game, all I can say is that 25 hours into this game I was only at a measly level 3. Gwent immediately took my focus as I attempted to gain recognition throughout Velen. It's a continuous side quest in the game, challenging notable opponents and entering tournaments, not only that but also every merchant is up for a game. I fondly remember building a great deck and coming out of a tournament as the winner, only for a local fishmonger to challenge me, and subsequently smash through any built up confidence I had established. There is also a quest to collect them all, so enjoy your time hunting for all 150 cards spread through the factions of Nilfgaard, Northen Realms, Monsters & Scoia'tael.I've always enjoyed games that heavily involve fighting, particularly when the mechanisms are right. People share mixed reviews about the mechanisms to Witcher 3 combat, some arguing that Geralt feels particularly stiff and robotic when under attack. I think combat can be pretty tricky in Witcher 3 especially for those unfamiliar with the series (me at first) - many different mechanics in play at any one time. Blocking, parrying, signs, pivots, rolls, variant of sword, etc. Practice makes perfect as they say, and it really does capture some superb fights between all that the world has to throw at you. Sit back and enjoy the dismemberment - Geralt doesn't hold off on his capability to carve through people, creatures and monsters like butter.16 Free DLC packages also accompany this incredible experience - adding even more into a well-packed game. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt had the best launch I've ever seen of a game, not to mention their update structure and responsiveness to people's comments early on. From launch there was new DLC every week, patches to address issues and bugs retaining in-game. Free DLC included new armor sets, the ability to visit a barber, new quests, contracts, animations, alternative looks, and not to forget the new game+ mode. Comfortably groundbreaking in every sense of the word, not to mention the magic of both outstanding DLCs ""Hearts of Stone"" and ""Blood & Wine"" which are comfortably worth their price.It is now 7 years on from when Witcher 3 was released and approximately 6 years from when I first wrote this review. I have been impatiently waiting for the remaster update to hit and today is the day that my dream has come true. It was nice to revisit my original screenshots and archived review, so much so that I thought it would be best to reupload (and tweak ever so slightly).Thanks once more to CDPR and for all of the enjoyment and dedication you've provided us as customers. It's been, for me, the most complete gaming experience I've ever had the pleasure of being part of. Simply the best.",positive

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"Overall: 9.5/10StandardScoreGraphics9.5/10Gameplay8.5/10Soundtracks10/10Main Story9/10Side Stories9.5/10Hearts Of Stones DLC9.5/10Blood And Wine DLC10/10NOTE:There will be mistakes in my english below, sorry for that but I will try my best to describe my experience while I was playing this game. Spoilers will be hidden in black, don't view them until you finish the game.Introduction:The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is an open world RPG game, you might have played a lot of RPGs in the past but trust me this one will be different, you will play as Geralt Of Rivia, your actions and choices will be the factor for every quest's ending. I'll be short and say: buy it, it's worth it and don't forget the dlcs they are so important and you will miss a lot if you don't try them.Should you play the previous games before this?The first question that comes to mind to every player who want to try this game is whether you should play Witcher 1&2 before this or no, the answer is it depends on you, sure Witcher 3 is a sequel and you might get confused if you don't play the first games (you will ask who is that and what is this place and what am i doing) but for me I didn't have to play them, I just watched recap of the previous games to understand whats going on and I recommend you to do as well before playing this game unless you wanna play the previous games, Witcher 1 has an old engine and graphics and most of you will not like the old gameplay system so you might skip it but for Witcher 2 its more modern than the first one and a lot of people recommend it, it explains even the storyline of the first game so It's all depend on your choice. And for the books you don't have to worry about them, the books and the games are different story not completely different but the books ended on a specific point of the storyline and the games made a sequel to that point and continued, characters, the world, the history is all imported from the books but you don't really have to read them to understand.The best plan I recommend is:- Watch Witcher 1 recap on youtube or read it on the internet.- Play Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings or just recap it.- Start your adventure in Witcher 3!NOTE:Witcher 3 has a special section for characters that describe a lot of things about them, there are also ""Books"" as an in game item you loot and gain additional information about the world.Difficulty:There are 4 Difficulties you can choose from at the beginning of the game, you can also switch it during the gameplay in the settings menu, I started my first playthrough with Blood and Broken Bones! (Hard) and I can say it's perfect, it doesn't make the game too easy or too hard, sure you might die sometimes but there is no fun in completing the game easily (in my opinion), Death March! (Very Hard)  is the hardest one and I only recommend it for NG+ (New Game plus is basically a new game with the same character and level you were using in the first playthrough including gears, swords, items...etc).So, i can say If you want to be challenged in your first playthrough go for Blood and Broken Bones! (Hard) but If you only want to finish the game and care only about the story go for Just the Story! (Easy) or Story and Sword! (Normal).Gameplay:The gameplay is a little complicated for new players, I had some difficult time learning it but you will get used to it by time, It relies on Level system, Skill Tree, Looting items and Gaining materials, and crafting weapons and gear. As long as you level up, you will upgrade your gear, obtain new skills and become stronger!The combat system isn't too hard, I didn't find any issue playing with mouse & keyboard, I find many people complaining about the combat system but I can't see any problem with it. each enemy has a specific level that tells you if you are ready to fight it or not.Story & Quests:In this game you play as Geralt of Rivia, a witcher which is a super-human (they have strong immune system and strong senses not like normal humans, they also live longer) made to kill monsters and get paid for that , I'll not go in details because you will learn more about them in the game.The game is Quest based, there are Main Quests (Campaign), Side Quests, Witcher Contracts, Treasure Hunt Quests, each quest has a level that tells you if you are ready for it or not, I recommend you to do all of the quests in level order. (If your level is 10 and the quest level is 15 don't do it until you reach 15)There are even Side Quests that affects the Main Story so don't skip them, Also Side Quests in this game are different than the other games, each has a different story and a different ending you will not feel at all like you are doing the same quest over and over again, and thats what I love about this game, skipping the Side Quests is totally a sin and you should never do that because you will play half of the game or even 1/4 of it, I even can say I enjoyed doing Side Quests more than the main ones.Buying this game without the DLCs is a sin too, Witcher 3 is known for it's unique DLCs some people even call B&W expansion The Witcher 4, they are full of content (new locations, new soundtracks, new stories...etc) So never buy this game without them.There is also a mini-game called Gwent, it's a card game, to be honest I wasn't interested in it, it's an optional feature and it's quests are optional too and they don't affect the story but If you are a hardcore gamer who wants all the achievements go for it, it's not hard at all and they say it's easy to learn.Choices & Consequences:YouTubeâ¢ Video:The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Killing Monsters Cinematic TrailerViews: 17,980,728CD Projekt RED is proud to present The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt ""Killing Monsters"" cinematic trailer to the public for the first time, offering a thrilling glimpse into the morally ambiguous...The hardest part in the game is not beating some boss or finishing some hard contract, but it's ""Picking Choices"", the game makes you feel like you are a witcher, almost all the aspects of the game are choices based, be wise and neutral and choose what you think is best for you and for Geralt, accept your fate that you draw with your own hands, don't look in the internet for the best choices to get the best results out of every quest, thats not how the game meant to be played.The problems with this game:""There is no perfect game in the world"" - random guy on the internet.I run into some glitches in this game during gameplay and cutscenes they are not a big problem but you notice them (just wanna say its not rare to run into one of them).The game lacks some physics like falling alone or while riding a horse (the horse will just disappear if you try to jump from a high area or in water).The npcs faces are similar and you might run into the same face a lot of times there is just few changes like the hair color or the clothes, sure I know that making unique faces take a lot of work and cdpr didn't have the budget for that  so I hope the next-gen version will work on that part more.There is a quest that broke the RPG rule which is ""Reasons of State"" a very important quest that decide part of the ending, In the end of that quest you will have two choices but because of the bad writing of that quest, the game indirectly force you and make you choose only one even If you don't want that choice because Geralt would never pick the other one.Conclusion:The positives of this game make you forget that the game has issues, It's a good game and a masterpiece and I hope the next-gen version will improve it.",positive

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"The Witcher 3 is one of the greatest RPGs ever made. You heard it at lest 100 times. But I am here to tell you why.Let's start with story. It's set in medieval fantasy word filled up with every creature from farytales you can think of and it's amazing. It's very exciting from start to end. It has some weaker points here and there, but It's still pretty solid. The story telling, cut scenes and voice acting are just perfect. This game has tons of side quests to offer. But it's not just simple 'Bring me something' or 'kill something'. Every quest has it's own story and different ways to complete it. Some of them are pretty funny to do too. Yes, you have lots of monster killing quests, but every time it's different type of monster, so you must use different type of tactics to kill it. The game world is HUGE. It's seperated into 2 bigger maps(Velen, Skelliege) and 3 smaller maps(White Orchard, Kaer Morhen and Castle at Wizyma). Every area has different coloring, music, nature, people and monsters. It's completely different worlds. Every world live it's own life. You can see day and night cycle, wildlife, villagers doing their daily routines, monsters hunting animals, weather changes and people yelling at you. It feels like you are in real world, not just in some randomly generated areas. Graphics are awesome even today. Everything has so much detail, sunsets are breathtaking and landscape is beautifully generated. The World has some bugs, but not any significant ones. RPG aspect of the game is great too. You have many skill trees to upgrade, lots of armours and swords to gain/craft/buy and tons of crafting materials. You can even collect herbs to make potions or bombs. You can drink these potions or use bombs in fight too. You can even buy seat, bags and blinkers for your horse.  Money si problem only at the start of the game, later, they are not a problem (unless you want to make every witcher gear armour in the game.). The biggest problem of the game is your horse Roach. She stucks at every tree and she can't go down hill. I know developers made fun of it, even at some quests, but it's still annoying. The Witcher 3 offers 3 mini games such as Gwent - very exciting card game with hours of fun, fist fighting and horse racing. You can join tournaments and win titules of champion and some valuable prizes. DLCs are not just regular dlcs. They're almots as big as standalone games. They have different, new and great story. Blood and Wine has It's own new world. If you want to beat the game without dlcs, but with every quest and area completed it will take you 150-175 hrs. With both dlcs, prepare to spend around 250 hrs in game.ProsExciting story from start to endBeautifully designed characters (with nice curves)Unique and entertaining side questsGreat RPG acpectsLiving world with awesom graphicsDiversity of individual areasNice voice acting and soundFantastic dialogues with charactersOriginal and huge dlcsConsVery few bugs in worldSome glitches in cutscenesRoach problemsOverallThe Witcher 3 is truly best RPG made in past years, maybe the best RPG ever made. It has exciting story living world and It's nice ending of the Witcher series. DLCs are masterpieces. It has so much content in it, but price is better then every AAA titles out there. If you are fan of the series, or not, go and buy this game at GOTY edition, you definitely won't regret it.",positive

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"Witcher 3 is a game whose story has received rave reviews. It describes a gray world that has never been seen in any other black and white games. While other games generally teach users the lesson of poetic justice that good always beats evil so we must do good, this game constantly gives a warning that sometimes strong evil can defeat good.Users who are forced to make a choice between the confusing line between good and evil usually believe in their own values and decide the direction of the game based on that belief. The choice sometimes leads them to bad results, which is not the way they intended. Such results serve as a useful tool for users to understand why flexibility is important in living in this world and how philosophy, belief, trust, faith, and love interact among people in a complex way so that such realization can naturally blend into their world view.Of course, not only the hero, Geralt, but all the other characters in the world view of Witcher have their own beliefs and believe that their values are right, fiercely confronting each other. In fact, the friendship and love or conflict and confrontation that arise in such confrontation is an element that adds fun to the story, but at the same time, it is a nasty one that causes confusion in our choices.I felt the greatest relief when the journey ended in Toussaint. Although the game tells us that good does not always win from end to end, The hero Geralt believed that human nature is fundamentally good and was warm to many people. Thus, I was greatly relieved to see a happy ending for him. After all, truly reliable friends are gathered together near a good man.Geralt's journey ended here. Although I would not hear any news for a while, I hope to hear from other Witcher's story someday. ^^",positive

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"Imagine you're working in a 9-5 corporate job, you're done with your work, you come back home, log onto Steam, see your games list for 5 seconds, buy a game on sale that you're never going to play and then switch off your PC and go to a bar. While having a drink, you think of the good times when games used to be fun and authentic. But then you tell yourself, the problem isn't the games, its you. ""Its not that games aren't fun anymore, you have gotten older"".And then I play Witcher 3. And suddenly I can't wait to get myself home after work. Do you have any idea how precious that feeling is ? The feeling that you are actually immersed in the protagonist' shoes. I find myself in anticipation and excitement for the new adventures that are waiting for me, I think while driving back home....""Where is this story headed ? What new places and characters I will meet ?"" And lets not talk about the characters. I thought myself as a guy who's dead on the inside and somehow these characters made me laugh, chuckle and empathise at the same time. I haven't felt these feelings for a game since 2008 when I played games such as Final Fantasy 12, Metal Gear Solid 3. Was I wrong to think that I was the problem and not the gaming industry that's shelling out mediocre AAA games with no memorable characters or storyline ?And I got this game for 3$. 3$ !! And that includes the DLC ! I honestly feel I looted these amazing devs. And I paid twice for games that are not even worth playing. 23 hours in and I still haven't scratched the surface of the story. The side quests are actually fun. I find myself doing the side quests more because its feels like I am watching another episode of the ""Witcher 3 TV show"". I love this open world, I actually take my time wandering around and exploring every nook and cranny. I haven't done this since GTA San Andreas. I look at some distant island or mountain that I find interesting and I decide to just walk there just for the fun of it. That's how beautiful this Open World this. This is Open World game done right.Thank you CD Projekt Red. You guys are a gem. I know its 5 years late and I don't know why it took me 5 years to play this, but better late than never.",positive

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"It was an amazing journey.I started playing this magnificent game in previous year and faced with the one thing (rare actually) i was scared to complete this game. When i was playing, completing mission after mission, i was think about end of the game and didn't want to see that, even to think about that. I was living this life, witcher life. I was traveled from village to village, from city to city, from forest to another forest. I met a lot of different , unique characters. Their voices, looks, demeanor , looks on world problems and world were different. Yes, it's unbelievable. In game you don't have the main mission - complete the game now. You can travel, look at all over places, beautiful places, landscapes, abandoned towers and castles, shattered camps . It's very atmospheric. I started using teleport only after 300 hours in this game. And now, when i finished the main story, i have plenty of the side-missions, contracts, and  thieves, bandits in my world. It's time to solve those misisons. When i was playing, i was full of emotions. I was like ""ohh, i want to be here, in this game"". On the weekends, i was making a 2 cups of a tea, closed door to my room and playing...or...lived? I'm still thinking, that my real life such a boring show... I was filled good emotions and worry. I was worrying about heroes.They became like a family to me. I felt that im part of this story. Now i'm writing review and i dont know my mood. It's a good and i think that something isn't completed yet. Why everything good have an end? Okay, those missions are for 50 more hours, but after that... The journey of the witcher isn't end. For me , this place - home. If i could change my life, choose any places to move to ( doesnt matter , move to place in real life or game ) i would like to live in this world. World which i like.Am i need to say something about graphics? About sound?*It's awesome. Everything in this game is awesome.The only bad thing about this game - is the emptiness you feel, after finishing it. And thats true.You know... Not each game can take your heart. This game did it. I mad about Witcher series, so, i'm gonna buy statuettes of all characters. I'm even thinking about to make other shelve, special for the witcher. It's unrealistic to explain your thoughts about something you love more than anything else.Perhaps, some of you guys will understand me , someone - not. But i want to tell you one thing - buy it, feel it.You have to feel it on your experience. These emotions after this game it's like a storm you can't stop.I want to say big THANKS to the developers, to the CD PROJEKT.Guys, you are my favorite company. You gave me in this series more , than i got in my real life. Actually, every work week i was waiting the friday evening, run home and i knew, that now, for this weekend im finally free. And it was from week to week. And on these weekends i finished this game (main story). To be honest, i don't even know what i have to feel, i feel  emptiness.I really love you and thank you, CD PROJEKT.You made the Masterpiece!",positive

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"Honestly this game is brilliant. I'm 30 hours in and feel like I have not even started yet. The maps are huge, and quite intimidating. There are lots of things to see and places to explore. Sometimes randomly exploring places you will find a hidden letter or item that leads you on a new quest. Speaking of quests, the secondary ones tie in beautifully with the main story and feel like they have meaning and purpose behind them. The visuals are stunning, especially if you have a rig capable of using HairWorks and HBAO+ to their full potential. The day/night cycle on top of the changing weather conditions really engross you in the world. The sound, both ambient and effects, are all awe inspiring. Just listening to the wind blow the trees, the village sounds of hammer on steel and axe on wood, even the gentle noises your horse makes as you travel is just very immersing.The story telling is one of the major positives for me personally. All the NPCâs really come alive with the texture and detail on their faces, CD Projekt RED did a great job with that. The voice acting is great, much better than Witcher 2 and feels far more professional. All of the conversation options are well thought out, and there are plenty of decisions with some severe consequences depending on the way you play it. If you import a Witcher 2 save, you will have a few surprises and reappearances as well.Combat is solid, it takes a little practice to get to grips with the dodging, parrying, and when to use the signs effectively, but once you work it out you will love fighting some mobs. The skill tress are varied and in-depth, and you can really tailor your play style by equipping/unequipping specific skills for different scenarios. Using mutagens to further develop and buff your abilities.There is so much more I could talk about like Gwent, the card game, bartering/intimidation mechanics, boat sailing, all the crafting and potions, but you need to play it yourself to really appreciate it. Hopefully with further updates and user mods the game will continue to improve and evolve.There are not many negatives, mostly performance related which, as of writing, a lot of have been fixed already with v1.03.",positive
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"The Witcher 3: Wild HuntHow do you even review The Witcher 3 in 2025?Everyone knows what it is and what it's not.Regardless, I played the game fully (Main game + ALL DLCs) for the first time now. It was an excellent experience. It took me around 130 hours, all sidecontent included, on the Death March! difficulty.I was expecting it to feel ""old"" in some ways, but I was gladly proven wrong quickly. The game looks amazing to this date, maybe due to the ""next gen update"" from 2022. The game looked and sounded great - maybe not as detailed as some newer games, but the art style carried and the design of the rather grim world of The Witcher still feels unmatched to this day. Novigrad especially I was surprised by - the city is vast, full of people and actually feels like a city rather than a level in a video game.Gameplay wise I had no real issues. Though the combat wasn't too deep, the variety in which you can build Geralt made up for it's simplicity. I went for a full Sign build (eg. magic) and had a blast weaving in devastating spells, while fending off enemies with parries of the sword and dodges. Death March! added some challenge and in some cases I used oils and bombs to further fight the various enemies and bosses. The best part about the combat was the variety of enemies. The Witcher 3 is full of very different creatures - man or monster - and a lot of different bosses (Witcher contracts mainly) that kept the game fresh throughout. Some recent games I've played had little in the variety department (Dragon Age: The Veilguard) which in those games made combat extremely repetetive.Looking past the combat, the game felt fresh due to it's amazing narrative. The story is gripping and every bit of the world feels alive and interesting. It's rare that a game's sidequests have as good or better storylines than the main objective, but the Witcher 3 has that in droves.And this is what the Witcher 3 does best.The stories. The Wticher, while very action-heavy, is an RPG. There are multiple endings, choices to be made that aren't cut and dry and therefore offer interesting stories to tell. I can't help but compare that approach to the genre again to my recently played games. The Witcher 3 did it better 10 years ago.To keep it short and sweet: Banger of a game, 10/10, even in 2025.Would highly recommend-especiallysince you can buy the whole lot on sale quite often for less than 15 EUR/$.",positive
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a very extensive game. There is a wide variety of content and forms of play within the game that will surely make the player play hundreds of hours. Its epic storytelling with a variety of interesting characters. This game is the best ARPG game ever launched.Personally I think with more than 100 hours of mission content on offer, it's a game that will be played for weeks. The money paid to buy it feels worth it.In fact, I strongly recommend that you take your time and play this game slowly and enjoy all the content and world in the game. This is because every content in this game is very detailed and well developed by CD PROJECT RED.",positive
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"10/10I'll be completely honest with the review, when I first got the game I pirated it ,After finishing my first playthrough I  just had to buy the game, it truly deserves the 60$.The story is so well written it got me so attached to the characters , that by the time that I finished it  I felt kinda sad that the journey was over and I  left the game aside for 3 months.I decided to return, now that the game has released 2 big dlcs , had played through the game twice doing normal playthrough and ""new game plus"" , it was fun even for the 3rd time.The enviroment , the colors, the soundtrack everything about the game is perfect.The 2 Main dlcs (Heart Of Stone , Blood And Wine):Heart Of Stone was great dlc that added content to some places that were considered as ""abandoned"" in the map, which was really nice.Now Blood And Wine, it adds a whole new location in the game , with unique storyline , Npcs , new enemies , Skills and alot more, and the ending was really a great way to finish a great series.I usually don't spend time on writing reviews, probably just wasted 5 minutes I won't get back , but I felt like this game deserves those 5 minutes . Also sorry if there were some grammer mistakes .",positive
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"Genre - Open Worlded Fantasy RPGI have played through the Witcher 1 and 2 until the end of both. Recently I read all the English translated books by Andrzej Sapkowski (a hero and they are highly recommended).I have already ploughed 80+ hours into this game by doing many exploration, sub and main quests. I am trying to have breaks so I will finish it eventually (unlike Skyrim, where I was Skyrim'd out).The monsters, characters and environments stay true to the Witcher world. You can tell the people who made this game really care about this game and its environment. They are providing free DLC, but you can buy a season pass if you want even more Witcher goodness.The fighting is fluid and there are horse races, crafting and collectible card games to add even more variety to a great well thought out game. Shame there are no sex cards this time though ;-)The graphics look great even on the lowest settings and each quest feels like a proper adventure, not just fetch some feathers or kill ten wolves because they look scary. You actually feel like you are making a difference to the world around you, liberating towns and developing relationships.This is one of the best games I have played. I won't say game of the year just yet, but it is clearly going to be in the top five!",positive

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"Product received for freeAs someone coming from The Elder Scrolls franchise, this game is something else.

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"10/10And thats not a fanboy or exaggerated ratingNever played the preceding 2 games.I was simply looking for an immersive open world game.Well gents,Immersive is one huge understatement.I'll make this short.I'm highly satisfied with my life. My golden retriever and choco lab give me joy. My wife and kids give me joy. My self-employed status gives me joy.But this game...It gave me depression when I finished it.Not because the game is depressing. But because I lived in its world and I got attached to it. How the game simulates the main characters and your interaction with them, makes this game feel so damn alive. Parting with the world after finishing the game, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ with my heart and my mind, really.I whole heartedly recommend this game.I strongly recommend taking anti-depressants when you reach the main quest: Final Preparations. Keep taking them meds for a month unless you want to orphan your family.CD Projekt Red, I would gladly ransom Tim Cook and use the money to fund your next witcher games.UPDATE:I finally stopped taking tricyclic antidepressants when I discovered the ""Multi-companion Mod"" from the nexusmods website. Don't look it up until you've finished the game. Just make sure to remember the mod and that I mentioned it (so you can send me free games as a sign of gratefulness). You'll thank me later for saving your life and for saving you money that you otherwise would have spent on medication treatment and therapy. My dogs are happy for me.UPDATE: 12/17/2017After reading the novels following my playthrough, I realized that the true spectacular art in CD Projekt Redâs The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, is how the game is truly built around the core story which was based on Andrezej Sapkowskiâs novels. The personalites and characters with every detail from the of world of Geralt of Rivia, was masterfully captured and used as the mold for this masterpiece of a game. Every why and every question you might have pertaining to the story will be answered by reading the novels. The motives and quirks of Geralt and the world heâs from has been transfigured to a game fitting of Sapkowskiâs brilliance. This game is undeniably a work of art. Game of the Year 2015, well deserved.UPDATE: Went back a year later and played it differently. I no longer rushed moving from point A to point B. This time I took in the scenery and environment as much as I could. Gorgeous.",positive

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"Everybody here needs to know what CDPR did to annoy the enthusiast community, why it's being review bombed, etc.CDPR has (probably in some arrangement with Nvidia) removed a well established and efficient lighting technology from the game that has been part of the beautiful visuals since 2015 (HBAO+) in order to make the ""Non RT"" part of the game look worse in comparison in this next gen version. People all around are praising comparisons for how ""good"" this RT implementation is, when in fact if you dig a little - you'll see what they've actually done is forced an update onto users with cut down lighting technologies in order to make the jump to RT more appealing. On top of this, you cannot (even with a 3090TI) get a stable 60 FPS on 1440p with RT on without going to balanced DLSS or performance DLSS where you begin to notice the distant terrains and detailed textures become washed out or pop in. It also constantly stutters - so not only is it RT we must use to regain our 2015 level (AT A MINIMUM) lighting quality, but also make the 4000 series more appealing because they're the only damn cards that can run it, never mind that many games like control or metro exodus were able to pull it off without needing to sell your left Kidney for a 4090.They do not deserve a positive review, because at best it's a poorly optimised implementation and at worst, a greedy, Anti-consumer ploy to upsell users onto newer graphics cards, specifically Nvidia (because AMD cards crash using RT on this game).I'm sorry it's come to this CDPR, but selling your soul to Nvidia - I've lost respect.",negative
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"Well... this is obviously a great game that everybody loves, or almost everybody...I sort of get why people love it, but I can't bring myself to like it. I'm guessing that the story is interesting, but the way it progresses is too circumvoluted. You want to find Ciri, and there's someone who has seen her. He's willing to tell you, but first you must help him find his long lost brother. Someone knows the brother, but he'll tell you only after you bring him a certain item. In order to find the item, you must get a map from a cartographer. The cartographer will give you the map in exchange for a love potion. The alchemist will do the love potion for him, but first you must get the herbs. The herbs are another continent, so you must hire a ship. To hire the ship, you must find the captain. Someone knows where the captain is but... well, this could go on for a long time. Obviously this isn't an example from the game, but that's how it feels to me, to the extent that I lose track of why I'm doing what I'm doing. I managed to keep some semblance of interest for the story and dialogue for about 25 hours, until I reached the stage where I didn't see the point anymore.A friend who loved the game suggested that I should focus on the main story instead of going for every side quest and activity, as I was doing (except Gwent, why would I want to waste my time with this?). I did, and managed to hold on for until the end (for a total of 45+ hours), all the while wondering whether I should just stop playing or not, since I was failing to really enjoy the experience. I believe it was only the game's reputation that made me persist in spite of my better senses. When I see that only 27% of players who have the game on steam have beaten it, it leads me to believe that many just dropped out of playing it, as I certainly should have done. I am a completionist, usually, and I tend to do every side quest and activity in a game, but there is no way I would force myself through more of this one, even though there is still a plethora of things to do.I believe another aspect of the game people enjoy is the combat. Though it's not as bad as in The Witcher 2, I still don't want to have to deal with all the mechanics that have been implemented in the game, I guess to spice things up. For a fight, I don't want to read the bestiary entry, put oil on my blade, sharpen it, gather herbs to make a potion, drink the potion, wash the dishes, choose the appropriate magic sign to use, embed my equipment with the right rune or whatever they are, hang the right trophy on my saddle, pick the right talent and attach it to the right mutagen, craft a bomb and clip my nails. At least they got rid of the traps, but it's still too cumbersome. Alchemy is probably the worst aspect, since it highlights how messed up the inventory system is, filled as it is with stuff that you'll never use. Navigating the interface can also be excruciating at times.Ultimately, the game falls short of the greats of the genre, and I even enjoyed the first Witcher game much more than this one. I'll keep my hopes up for the next game nevertheless.",negative

I feel your just a passanger to the main character instead of feeling like the actual main character and just stab the spacebar to get through the dialouge. I enjoyed and was thrilled with the first 2 hours but the next 30 felt like a dry chore. Also I feel like theres about 3-4 songs in the entire game that play through over and over.

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"This game is broken after the ""next gen"" update. On a 3090 @1080p max settings, I'm barely touching 60fps with dips into the low 40s. On top of that, the frame times are awful. I also getting more than 70ms render time. The game feels terrible and I would NOT recommend this to anyone. If I can't hold 60fps consistently on a 3090, then stay the hell away from this. This game deserves to be review bombed with how much they screwed with the whole thing.RTGI is insanely heavy, reducing FPS by about 40. None of the other settings in the game seem to affect your frame rate at all. DLSS and FSR 2 just straight up don't work. All they do is reduce texture clarity by a lot and don't give any performance back in return. I tested all modes on both and it's the same. TAAU has exactly the same performance as DLSS and FSR 2 and looks significantly sharper.This update is a mess and no one should have to deal with this.",negative

I'm not even sure if there is much point to the plot. It seems to be a random snippet of a book, finding someone. I feel very frustrated with this game, and therefore it's not fun or fulfilling.

But even with all the improvements, I still just found myself, whenever listening to the richly detailed backstories of every questgiver, shouting ""I CANNOT BEGIN TO DESCRIBE HOW MUCH I DOOOON'T CAAAARE!""So I'll deny this game a recommendation specifically for those who hated Witcher 1 and 2 and who are simply wondering ""Will the 3rd time be the charm""?And hey, maybe it will be, but It wasn't for me.

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"This is a fantastic and detailed story. But that's it. Great story. This is a video game. I'm judging this purely as a game, and I can't recommend it that much.Combat is clunky and broken. Biggest fault with the game. Your attacks are at best, cool, and at worst, unsatisfying. The combat has zero weight to it. It's just dodge, kill, dodge, kill. It doesn't really test your brain like other RPG's. Now I know you might say, well aren't all RPG's like that, and yeah, you're not wrong. But other RPG's give you cool loot and exciting weapons as a reward, which I'll get to in a second.Physics are even worse. Geralt can barely jump a 2 foot gap, and rushes way too fast. For a game about looting literally everything imaginable, this is a massive problem.Speaking of loot, why isn't it cool? I never felt like I was getting cooler stuff throughout the game. With how much stuff there is in the game, it's really hard to be impressed by anything. Most items serve one purpose, and weapons just do more damage with a couple tweaks at times. You never feel like you're growing a stronger character or becoming more powerful. You feel like you're just scavenging with no purpose. I count like three times where I felt like I was getting some cool loot.Roach, the horse, is god awful. Geralt's physics are bad, but Roach makes him look like an acrobat. Getting stuck on terrain, stopping dead in the tracks for no reason, getting stuck on literally every fence possible. I mean, even the developers made fun of this dumb horse during the Blood and Wine DLC! They added a conversation where Geralt was talking about why Roach gets stuck on literally anything, and they never bothered to fix it?Side quests are cool, but there is very little reason to tackle them. You barely get any money, and possibly some new weapons, and 100 more herbs.Look, I will say Witcher 3 has an incredible story. There's no doubt about that. The graphics, characters, plot and world are amazing. But this is a video game, not a movie or a book. So unless you care for the story, and the story ONLY, I suggest not to buy this game.",negative

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"Most negative reviews are along the lines of ""It's not a bad game, but it's not for me I guess.""But the thing is: it is a bad game; it just knows how to dazzle you for a while.The game world itself is big, beautiful & well crafted. At first, it seems full of endless possibility. But as they say, ""wide as an ocean, deep as a puddle"".The thing is, all the things that are really important are really lacking. Here's why you shouldn't play this game:The main story is drawn-out, boring, and nonsensical. It feels like it's randomly generated, making itself up as it goes along. There are lengthy forgettable tangents just to elongate the game.Main & side quests alike are almost all a matter of a) follow pointer to location b) activate witcher senses & follow red footprints/scent, c) kill person/monster. Repeat, many times.Combat is atrocious. It's practically no exaggeration to say: all fights require the same 'strategy' from beginning to end: slash, slash, dodge - from lowly bandits to the final boss. Slash, slash, dodge.If you do much exploring & side questing, you will find yourself grossly over-levelled for the the main story & other side quests. You can turn on enemy up-scaling, but this is a crummy workaround.The inventory is really tedious as always, making it a real chore to drink potions, apply oils etc.The differing gear makes so little difference to the way you fight. Nothing pushes you into a certain build with strengths & weaknesses. Choosing between gear is never exciting or crunchy. Just choose the higher damage / armour number.The crafting system is largely pointless and can be ignored.The build system offers very little in meaningful change to combat or gameplay.Like the other Witcher titles, cut-scene interactions are many, poorly paced, & filled with silent gaps and long isolated gestures. Also, many quests are filled with 'follow this person at a really slow pace while they talk and trigger scripted events' passages.So many long scripted events during which you can't quick-save!A lot of the above can be summed up as: there's no player agency. There's nothing to you can push or pull to ""play your way"". All the systems just don't work (together or alone!) - none of them are fun: combat, skills, crafting, questing... all of them are implemented as if by someone new who had seen them in other games and decided ""Hey, I can do that in my game.""This game is a long cutscene that you move Geralt through; to call it an RPG is an insult to that label. Sometimes you activate witcher senses and walk around; sometimes you slash, slash & dodge. After a long time, it's over. And you wonder why on earth you wasted so many hours on it.",negative
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"Highly controversial opinion apparently but:After 200+ hours in this game, 66% achievement rate, both expansions and being almost at the end of the game.... I just would not recommend it to others.Reasons1) I find it boring. Once you realise that every mission is rinse and repeat the same thing, it just feels like a drag. ""Go fetch this item"" or ""Go kill this person/monster"". The story reasons behind it always feel shallow, a cheap justification to keep the player going. You never feel invested in the reasons. Every mission is exactly the same mission, with different skin. It's basically grand theft auto with medieval skin. If you've played enough games like that, this just feels as extremely repetitive.2) The story is ok... if you are a 20 year old. I'm 37 now and I've read a lot of books and played a lot of games so my standards might be high, but I just found the overall writing -story, characters, dialogue etc- very poor and 2 dimensional. It's all so extremely cliche, trope upon trope, a 16 year old boy's self insert fantasy. Gerald is just the most boring, bland, every-man guy. We never see why people like him, we're just TOLD people like him. Why are Gerald's friends his friends (with the exception of other witchers)? We never see a bond form, we're just TOLD, that they are friends so that just justifies everything that comes next. Women are attracted to him. Why? He's as bland as an unflavoured bowl of porridge. It truly feels like every female character was written by a man that doesnt understand women well. Women only exist in this universe to throw their panties at Gerald for being such a irresistible man-stud. They are there just to reinforce and validate how awesome Gerald is. And it just comes across as fake and 2 dimensional. And Dandelion. Any scene with dandelion is so cringe and idiotic that it completely broke immersion from what little story build up there was. The whole purpose of Dandelion as a character is to be the comic relief buffoon. The over-the-top moron who's there to -again- validate what a manly-man-man and clever Gerald is. It's just all so cringe and dumb. And Ciri, dont get me started on ciri. She's even more boring and vapid than Gerald. We're constantly TOLD that she's emotionally important, but we never actually SEE it in the game. She has this birthright/prophecy blah blah whatever who cares.3) Game difficulty, even at the higher difficulties is just easy and the same thing over and over. Just roll around, dodge and hit. Woo! How many hours are you supposed to do this before it gets boring? At higher difficulties the monsters just do more damage with a single hit, so just dodge them completely and... over.4) Items and upgrades. I'll admit that levelling up the skills was interesting, but that can be maxed out almost before half the game is over. And you dont have that many skills slots, so most of them are useless anyway once you decide what build you're going for. So that gets boring fast. As for items/gear, the game provides a lot of flavour with random drops but... the game designers then shot themselves in the foot and made it all pointless by introducing the special witcher gear you can collect. Why would you ever use any other gear other than the witcher schools? So that got pointless and boring soon too.Pros:Graphics are good, I guess; I work as a senior/lead visual effects artist in films, so to my eyes it all looks like â¥â¥â¥â¥, but I guess by video games standards it's good; Who cares. Visual effects are advancing so fast that what was considered amazing 3-5 years ago is now considered sub-par. Graphics just dont interest me, but if I was to commend on that: you see the exact same skin character repeating over and over again in the game. You're seeing the same asset being reused in different stories as a different character. And that's 1 in 3 characters in total in the game. As for women characters, they are all the exact same model reused over and over. Because there's only 1 type of woman in the world. They all move in the exact same way - which seems to be how a man who doesnt spend a lot of time around women, thinks women move - in a cliche, cringe way.Audio is good, I guess; But every time I had to listen to Gerald's boring blunt, over-the-top husky manly-man voice I had to roll my eyes back into my skull.Maybe I'm too old for this game. Maybe if I was 18-22 when I played it, I probably would have thought its amazing and the women's characters were the best I had ever seen. But right now, this game bores me so much I dont think I'm even going to finish it.",negative
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"I love this game, one of the best games that we will see in our lifetime. But the most recent update (4.02) is causing multiple crashes despite the DirectX version I choose or my graphics settings.I've never had any issues playing this game for over 300 hours and 2 playthroughs until they randomly decided to ""update"" my beloved game. Now I experience more bugs/glitches and random crashes to the point where it will no longer let me load my save files and even disabled my graphics card on me.Absolutely play this game, but only when they fix this ""update"".",negative

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,Got a new GPU (AMD 7900 XTX) and decided to revisit this game. Turns out the 4.0 patch ruined the game completely and it now runs like crap with awful stuttering.It was perfectly playable on my old GPU (AMD Vega 64) with 4K resolution and high settings. Now it runs even worse and is literally unplayable. And it looks like I'm not the only one with this problem.,negative
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"Do not buy this game as it is now. What CDPR did is equivalent to a mechanic breaking into your garage, tinkering with your old, yet perfectly functional car, and then leaving it with a few new bells and whistles but the engine now runs like â¥â¥â¥â¥.",negative
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"I'd like to start with some statements first:* I absolutely adore the old version, and consider it one of the best action RPGs I've seen* Next-gen update is a free update, and at this moment (March 2023), you still can access the old version, v1.32 -- and I sincerely recommend you to do so.* All of my negative impressions are related specifically to the next-gen updateWith that said, let's vent.This patch, as I see it, is a confirmation that CDPR doesn't really know how to properly QA their products before actually shipping them, nor intends to learn anything about it.Cyberpunk was the first red herring: I've bought it a year before the release, hoping that our CDPR friends will deliver the product of the same high quality as Witcher 3. Instead, I got a game filled with bugs and optimization issues up to the brim, and had to wait a year before actually giving it a chance. Sure, you may argue that Cyberpunk is way better now, and it's a whole different game today, but the fact stands -- it took them almost two years to actually deliver a game which somewhat resembles the stuff they've been promising to their customers for almost a decade.And now this next-gen update ships. I was kind of hoping that the situation with Cyberpunk release actually moved a few stones here and there, and whilst I remember that Witcher 3 was buggy on release as well, it never was THIS buggy.Yeah yeah yeah, this is a free update, I can't complain about them bringing new content to the game, yadda yadda yadda. I know.I'm complaining that they've broken the game which never needed fixing.I mean, just take a look at this list of issues I've encountered on my rig (Ryzen 5 3600 with no OC + 16 Gb RAM + 3070 Ti):* DX12 mode performs horribly: uneven CPU threads usage, thus constant stutters, thus incorrectly taxed GPU, which is clocked up to the brim, even though it's not used.* RT mode kills the performance all the more, which is a shame, 'cause this is one of the first games in the past few years where it actually makes a real difference. The performance hit is big enough for me to forget that I have RTX-enabled GPU.* DLSS and FSR do not really help: their implementations are far from perfect, with DLSS performing actually WORSE on an NVIDIA GPU than FSR 2.1* DX11 mode lost a few of graphical options, namely, HBAO+. Also, stutters quite heavily as well, although not as much as DX12 version.* Overall stability is borked: when using DX12 mode game crashes quite often, sometimes dragging the whole system with it.As for the numbers: I'm running 2560x1080 resolution, and I rarely see anything above 60 FPS on average while outside of towns and cities, and I barely scrape above 30 FPS on occasions such as Hierarch Square in Novigrad, or Toussaint (pretty much everywhere within city limits). And this is with DLSS enabled and RT disabled.Once again: I'm not running RT with these settings. This is purely rasterized mode.I admit, I'm running Ultra preset with Ultra+ set for textures, but come on: I have Cyberpunk running better at very high settings, with better looking picture, proper DLSS implementation, and with RTX enabled. The hell?All in all: I would recommend to stay away from this game in this state for everyone who's considering purchasing right now. Your impression would be plagued with stability issues and bugs, and bearing in mind that this is STILL ONE OF THE BEST GAME OF THE PAST DECADE -- please, just wait a bit until CDPR fixes their â¥â¥â¥â¥ up.As for those who already owns the game -- back-up your saves and roll back to the old version (you can select v1.32 on the Beta tab of the game settings in Steam Library), 'cause right now it's a mess of a product, and you really should hold off. No new features are worth stability, visual consistency and overall performance. I mean, you've lived without RT and new textures for seven years already, so just wait a month or two more.If somebody from CDPR will stumble upon this: guys, we know that you can produce great games, with captivating stories and engaging, believable characters. Please get your â¥â¥â¥â¥ together, set up your QA processes already. If release at this date and in this state, on the other hand, was a management's decision, then I would strongly suggest you to learn already from your mistakes. Two botched releases are more than enough. Or just quit the company and try yourself at another trade.",negative
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"Since everybody seems to love this game and I like RPG's, I immediately bought it when it came out. Played it for 3 hours and got bored. Half a year later, I tried again and forced myself to play 5 hours, had an okay time but never felt like playing it again. Then, 3 years later the Netflix show came out and I enjoyed that - third time's the charm, isn't it? Well, no. Killed a griffin, rode around on a horse, got annoyed by clunky combat mechanics and awkward movement, so I stopped playing again. Now, during covid-19, I got bored again, so I felt like giving the game one last shot. I played for around 10 hours this time and got into the story a bit, and that part I enjoyed. The core gameplayloop of mindlessly picking up flowers to craft oils to beat a ghost to then do the same thing over and over again wouln't be too bad, were the combat a bit more responsive. Fighting against 5 enemies at a time is supposed to be impossible I guess, but that doesn't make such situations more fun in a videogame. I want to hit someone, so I need to lock on, can't rly choose who to lock on to, the game picks for you. So push the change target button 3 times till you're on the right one. try hitting it, the first response of every enemy is to doge your first attack - counterattacking is much more effective. So what at first glance looked like quite a deep combat system devolved into assassins creed like ""mash the parry button at the right time"".I'm not saying the game is bad. I'm saying it's not for me. After having tried getting into it 4 times I felt I had to write this.",negative
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"""Let's update our 7 year old game and make it run like garbage on modern hardware. The main selling point of which is RT makes the game tank into oblivion. It'll make Cyberpunk look better since it actually runs better than The Witcher. Maybe if we also add a launcher on top of it the gamers like us even more.""""Wait... What if we make it crash when you try to turn on RT while playing the game. That way gamers can see the launcher again when they have to reboot it!""""That's pure genius. Let's ship it boys it's gone gold.""No wonder they didn't let people see the PC version before release. It's in shambles. Even if you don't want to us the new RT features the game runs much worse than it used to. I don't know who thought this was a good idea but CDPR are somehow tanking their reputation even lower with this sloppy release. They should just close shop and stop making games or find competent management.",negative
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"[9th October 2024] - Hoped I'd find the game running better after so long and returning to test but performance is still choppy and left in a very un-optimised state on the newest patch :([4th January 2023] - Performance is still very unstable and has issues compared to the 1.32 patch update.â¢ A tip for people wanting to continue from old saves too - old PC saves work but aren't compatible really as they cause a lot of bugs and add to performance issues also, from my tests anyway.*Edit still having random frame drops and stutter since the optimisation hotfix patch, not sure if the Geralt black facial hair glitch is still happening though but I didn't see it when I tested it again*I love this game and it's one of my favourites but this new update is so unoptimised for older cards like my 1660 Super, the patch 1.3 version of the game ran smooth at 1440p for me with 60fps minimum and this new version is full of bugs, and I suffer from stuttering and drops from 70fps down to 20fps randomly, even when dropping my settings down from what I originally played the game with before this ""update"".As for my critique on the update, I like the new texture upgrades, the water is nice, I won't be playing with any of the Netflix inspired stuff because I'm against that and what that show made to try to destroy in my favourite Franchise. I can't say about how the RTX features work but I'm sure they're nice and I like the Shadows Ultra+ setting from testing it at 1080p though it was buggy in places and shadow colours didn't match the sky or weather system and looked very odd from an artist's perspective [Tested in White Orchard+Velen+Skellige] the sun lighting in Velen was very bright too when compared to identical saves from the original. As for the weather system, I liked how Toussaint looked with the new atmosphere when compared to the original but with White Orchard and Velen the game has really lost something that it once had; it looks nice, yes... but it is so clean now and doesn't have almost as much of the gritty and mysterious atmosphere that it once had in the original, Crookback Bog is especially different and there's only a hint of what once was, still there... the dark overcast skies and moody weather, mixed with the haze and fog around the swamps and forested areas and villages; nearly all gone and replaced with just a haze. Only a hint of that nice mysterious horrific atmosphere that was once there can be seen now... I'm not a fan of that. :(One main repeated glitch I encountered was that Geralts facial hair would randomly turn black and this wasn't a problem before this update, Also I'm guessing it's due to the new integrated 'Red Launcher' but the Steam overlay feature and ability to screenshot through steam is completely broken and unusable in game. An in game hint of some kind of where the photos are saved in the new integrated photo mode would also be helpful.I hope you see this CDPR and you can work to optimise the game more anyway because it really is a shame, I planned to replay the game from the beginning on this new update and I just can't... I love Witcher 3, it's my favourite game and I've made so many drawings and paintings from it as well as cosplays by both me and my brother, but this is unplayable for me in the current state with frame drops and stuttering so much that I have to play on lower graphics settings than before, just to achieve semi stable performance. And I can't get any further hours on the game or any achievements via the backed up old 1.32 patch version of the game. Really wish this new update was just a separate copy added to our libraries on steam like how Metro did it with the Enhanced edition or other games like Bioshock did it for free with Remastered versions.",negative

It's just a dark, muddy sight now.I have no idea if i can roll it back somehow. Didn't find any solution. Severly disappointed.",negative
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"I don't know my friends, too much hype for this game.I have forced myself to play and like it for 17 hours, which is something I don't usually do to this extend.Due to all the positive feedback i thought to give it a try again after all this years.Still the same result , cannot grab my attention.It feels more of the same actions over and over with the addition of good story quests. Overall its just dull to my eyes.Gameplay wise it has not been able to hold me on my chair.I guess its just not for everyone!Last update before i drop this game forever, i gave it another 10hours of game time to see if i really miss the point by all this hype.Nope the game is actual â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, buggy as â¥â¥â¥â¥ even 5years after realease, crashes whenever you alt+tab omegalol.Clunky clunky junk junk gameplay story is great so just read the books to be honest.The amount of hype for this hot â¥â¥â¥â¥ is what is wrong with gaming world. 1/10 my final score, its actually worse than cyberpunk.My advice not ever buy it out of 40friends who own it only 3 have beraly finished it with some 40-60 hours and 1 has like 400hour(dont know why) so yeah everyone buys the game and after 3 hours never touches it again it must be the best game ever  like the hype suggests!",negative
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"I'll just get to the point. The Witcher 3 loses serious steam once you begin the Novigrad portion of the game. Granted, the game is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ gorgeous, and the Velen + Bloody Baron questline is really damn good. However, once you wrap that area up and move ahead to Novigrad, the pacing of the game comes to a screeching halt. The missions and the characters become much less interesting than what you experienced in Velen. Paired with the kinda â¥â¥â¥â¥ gameplay, it doesn't become a joy to play through anymore. Granted, the quality of the sidequests remains the same, and preperation for the Witcher contracts is a lot of fun, regardless of where you are, but I really had to push myself to finish Novigrad. Once you begin Skellige, the third area of the game, it does begin to speed up again, but I was never really able to get back in like I was before. Also, the open world is really just not that interesting. Sure, you've got HUNDREDS of icons plaguing the screen, but after a while they sort of start to blend together, and it starts to feel a bit like Assassins Creed. This is one of those games that would have benefitted greatly had it been linear or a semi-linear open world. Overall, I just couldn't get into it. Maybe you will, but if you're tired of open world games and don't have the patience to deal with tank-y awful gameplay, it's not worth it. Maybe on sale.",negative
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"i played this game for 50 hours only to realize how burnt out I was with all the extra side content I'd been doing. on paper, the story is interesting, and don't get me wrong, the main story line is perfectly fine, but when you're doing another monster hunt for another troll for another 200 coin reward you start to get numbed by the gameplay and the ""open-world"" nature of the game. the skill tree is for the most part useless (as someone who played on the hardest difficulty offered) because the game is already way too easy if you just spam Quen and never take damage (you literally never get punished).this game would've been better as a linear story based game tbh",negative
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"First of all this is not a totally negative review it's close to neutral, but since there is no neutral button, i've marked it as negative.My review based of 150h playtime in GOTY version(non steam).I can understand why this game have such a high users rating and i want to explain why is not objective:This game cause extremely high impression by stuining storyline(mostly not by main storyline itself but by loads of details and sidequests which do not cease to amaze a player until the end of the game), loads of unque and memorable characters, very beautiful picture(one of the best engine so far), variety of different locations what makes this world so alive, altogether this game make you addicted to this world and you want to live in it and be a part of it, this is where player forget that this is not a movie or book, this is a GAME, i don't know how you guys but when i play a game i want PLAY but not watching movie 90% of a time that i spent in it.And here we go, the downsides:1. Main problem of this game is balance between gameplay and ""movie"".2. Quality of gameplay is like 100x times worse than quality of everything else in this game and looks super cheap:a) Combat: on difficulty lower than ""Death March"" it's â¥â¥â¥ faceroll, you may forget about gameplay and just watch a movie, even ""Death March"" is faceroll at certain point with proper setup of your character, untill fight with Eredin(last boss of main story) and some of the bosses in DLC.b) Items progression: 99% of items in this game is useless since set items is superior to anything else, except some unique items from DLC and after 40+ lvl there is no way to upgrade set items, i will extend this problem later when will talk about NG+.c) Character progression: certain build is owerpowered compared to others(especially melee+alchemy), there is realy zero balance in skills, especially in blood and wine when you will have an access to mutations. In example in my playthrough no one could survive more than 2 hits, only super unique bosess was durable enough to fight back, I want to note that I've played on ""Death March"" difficulty.d) Alchemy: most interesting part of gameplay but also is far from perfect, if paired with certain skills becoming overpowered.e) Replayability: extremely poor, it's like watching a movie again right after credits since gameplay is most weak part of Witcher 3. NG+ does not provide you with new enemies, does not affect AI of the enemies, does not add new mechanics to enemies, does not add new items. I want to talk more about item progression in NG+, this is most ridiculous trash, items that you find in NG+ has absolutely the same special stats as analogs from NG the only difference is bases stats(damage for weapon and armor for clothes) in example one of the firt 5 lvl relic sword in NG has 2% crit chance and 8% crit damage and it's analog in NG+ will have ~55 lvl(only affect base damage) and also 2% crit chance and 8% crit damage â¥â¥â¥ lol, my 48 lvl sword from Blood and Wine has 100% crit damage, 20% crit chance, 15% chance to ignite and outstand this 55 lvl trash even with notable difference in base damage. Same with witcher sets, 40 lvl grandmaster set outstand 60lvl NG+ sets, you have to wait untill 100 lvl to finnaly equip new set :DMy conclusions: Witcher 3 has extremely high quality of content, tons of details in such a huge world, i really impressed by work that ""cd projekt red"" did, it was one of the best movie that i've seen, but medicore game. I really can't understand how they could make such a beautifull world and such a crap gameplay, too high contrast between those parts of the game. I would rate this game as this:Content: 11/10Graphics: 9/10Gameplay: 4/10If you think to by or not, diffenetely BUY it, the price for this game is very cheap in my opinion.As for myself I do not regret about a single minute spent in the game, had a lot of fun, still under impression. But i had to make this review, i hope ""cd projekt red"" will learn their mistakes and will bring gameplay to the same level as content. Cheers.",negative
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"4.0 Broke this game completely. It was running perfect for me, and as someone who wasn't keeping up with all of the other bugs, I hardly noticed any. Then 4.0 came out. I'm a huge fan of adapting DX12 and graphic overhauls, but now I cannot play the game at all. Always CTD (crash -to-desktop). I have reinstalled, reinstalled video graphic drivers, deleted all saves, tried a new game, reset all driver graphic profiles...nothing has worked.",negative
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"Performance is awful since 4.0 both in DX11 and DX12 (R5 5600 with 2080 Ti).Both with and without ray tracing the game stutters a lot and has crashed more times since the patch than in my entire two playthroughs before the ""next gen""-features were introduced.",negative
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"After 7 years since the game released and running flawlessly since release. They have destroyed the optimization of this game and also added a â¥â¥â¥â¥ ton of crashing issues. There is also this weird thin black border around the game no matter what resolution/display mode I use in DX12.With everything set to the new graphics settings ""Ultra+"" with all Ray Tracing features On and DLDSR(3413x1440) + DLSS(quality/sharpening low) active. The game looks absolutely fantastico without any mods. But runs at about 20-40fps... Turning off the Ray Tracing features puts the game back to 100fps+ but yet the new crashing issues remain.The new ray tracing features are really nice at first but you will soon notice that the global illumination ruins shadows against bright colors making it overall look like crap (especially with motion blur active). The ray traced shadows and ambient occlusion are the two best thing that they've added but to have these settings active you must have global illumination on to even use these features. The ray traced reflections are not entirely true as they are a hybrid between screen space effects as well.Thankfully running the game in DX11 seems to fix the crashing issues so far as I have not crashed at all on it. Though I use to be able to run v1.32 at 150+ fps. Now the new v4.00 of the game runs at around 100-120. DX11 is also missing DLSS and FSR. But it does contain the new TAAU AA setting which makes it look a lot better than the original game. If you are gonna play the game, make sure you use the DX11 version as the DX12 version is borked.The new graphics settings have also fixed the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ pop in the original game had which is a huge plus for me. Hopefully in time they will fix this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ so the game runs better. Cause at the moment it has essentially been downgraded to cyberpunks  optimization quality.",negative

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"The Witcher 3 is easily in my top 10 games of all time. I was so engaged and immersed in this world, the characters, the stories, even side-quests have depth, and the world has so much to discover, two amazing DLC's including one that adds an entire new open world map that looks so high fantasy it's breathtaking. The only reason for the negative review is this.Next Gen Update for PC is currently in an unplayable state and should not have been pushed out with this terrible optimisation. Can't load old saves with RT on, game crashes. Can't play with RT settings once in game otherwise game crashes. Game crashes regardless every 30min-hour. RTGI ALONE, drops me from 100+ fps where I was in Skellige to 35-40 fps. CDPR go have a look at Metro Exodus Enhanced which uses RTGI with INFINITE BOUNCES and RT Reflections, whilst still running on my 3060Ti, Ultra Quality 1440p, DLSS Quality at 70-100 fps (Yes even in the Taiga level, which is FAR heavier graphically than anything in the Witcher 3, even in this update) Basically, I feel like early PC copies weren't given out very much, or for review early, because they must of known how bad the optimisation was. It's abysmal. At least CDPR have said they are looking into this on Twitter already, so I'm hoping for a few quick patches (for a patch lmao) that increases performance via optimisation and gets rid of the consistent crashing, not being able to load into old saves with RT enabled, the stuttering, etc etc etc. If you haven't already bought the game, I highly recommend waiting until CDPR fixes this mess of an update. Currently it's nearly unplayable. Sorry state of PC gaming these days, and I was so damn excited for this. Oh, and DLSS doesn't improve frame rate either, is it even working? Sucks because it really does look bloody AMAZING with the updated graphics, but unfortunately, the optimisation/bugs/crashes ruin the entire experience. CDPR, please optimise this update, there is no way in hell a 7 year old game with a graphical update runs far, far worse, than a heavier game like Metro Exodus Enhanced with everything on Ultra including the RT settings.10/10 GAME0/10 OPTIMISATION",negative
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"UPDATE 1:Now the end game crashes no matter what when I approach anywhere near the inn. Fast travel, walking, on horseback, everything makes it crash.UPDATE 2: Worked only by NOT going on a path. Cutting across a field worked to complete the game, however going on a path or fast traveling crashes the game.I love this game, over 500 hours of my life have been dedicated to this. But in it's current state, I cannot recommend this game.THE BAD1. Performance.Once you get into Novigrad, frame rates and performance take a nose dive. We're talking single digit frame rates sometimes on a 3080. This was not the case on the older version of this game at all. Fighting in the city becomes a hack and slash and hope you win because the latency also spikes when the rates drop. This occurs not just in Novigrad, but whenever there are more than about 10 NPCs around.THIS IS NOT THE CASE EVERYWHERE. In the open world or most places in Skellige, the game performs amazing and you can really appreciate the update.2. Inventory BugThere is a HUGE problem where your inventory that is equipped on you disappears, but is still equipped. The only way to see it, is to equip something else and then re-equip the gear you want on. However, once you leave the inventory menu, the bug comes back and you are back to the same place. This is extremely frustrating and should not be a thing.3. GPS is broken.The GPS that leads you on paths will sometimes lead you down a different road than you should be going and then cuts back over to the other road, most of the time through buildings or not using a road to get back to where you are going. The GPS is highly unreliable when you have a decision to make with a fork in the road.Update 1: This is still frustratingly broken. It works 50/50, in all honesty, but it cannot be relied upon.4. Roach's mechanics are worse than the original game.Roaches mechanics are very clunky compared to the original. For example, when galloping down a road, if the road turns too hard, regardless if you turn the mouse and screen to follow the path, Roach will usually NOT follow the road he is galloping on. He will veer off directly ahead and then break the pathing he was on.Update 1: Lots of invisible walls on paths Roach cannot go through in Skellige.5. Able to pass through doorsSo far I have found this three (3) times. All of them on mission doors. The first was in the coroners door. I was able to go right through the front door without out opening it and before being allowed in. This caused the game not to proceed, but I could interact with any content expect dialogue. The second was at Dandelion's place during the early parts of his side quest to find him. The third was at Dijkstra's bathhouse. I could pass through the front door without knocking the first time.Update 1: An Additional one found during the meeting in the warehouse to plot...(no spoilers)6. Impassible objects on the road, like treesGetting caught on tress has been one of the most annoying things of this update so far. Once you get stuck within a tree because you broke an impassible plane, getting out usually requires a reload. This happened a lot to me in Skellige, especially on the isle where you fight the Ice Giant.7. Quality of NPC's clothingThere are many times where the quality of NPC's clothing goes full CP2077 on a PS4 mode and is just a blend of colors and no detail. This usually happens on their arms, but occasionally it goes all the way up to their shoulders.THE GOOD:1. Graphics, when you are not in a city.The team did a great job with polishing the graphics on the updated version. When you are riding around Velen, the landscape looks beautiful.2. Quality of the Characters in Dialogue.Geralt, Yen, Triss, all of the main character's detail is amazing. You can tell they really focused on the facial expressions and quality there.3. Igni and Aard more polishedNot much to be said other than they are much more polished.OVERALL:The game overall is an amazing game that is suffering from horrible bugs that seem endemic of CDPR as of late. I think they will iron out these bugs, but as of now the game is very hard to play and enjoy. I will update this when there is a change.",negative

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"I just... can't get into this game.I think I enjoyed the first like 3 hours of gameplay (I can't remember, I got it a long time ago when it was on sale) but after trying to pick the game back up several times, I just find it frustrating and tedious. The combat system just seems unintuitive, and the enemies are rather irritating to deal with. I have essentially been stuck on the Family Matters side quest every time I start the game again, because even after I deal with the bloody wraiths that teleport and damage you, I have to go through several cutscenes and walk down a long ass road to a bridge covered in Rotfiends. The Rotfiends take like 20 hits to take down, and they don't stagger very easily so it feels like a slog. Even after killing them, more just appear out of nowhere to continue the fight. The issue is that it doesn't feel like a high intensity kill-or-be-killed fighting system. It lacks any sort of impact. My weapon just kind of hits brushes them and does damage, and getting hit just kind of boops me back. That being said I'm coming from Dark Souls III, which has a much higher focus on 1v1 encounters and timing, rather than the hack-and-slash feel that I get from Witcher III.I upgraded my PC this January, and I reinstalled the game a day ago to try it out after boosting the graphics and frame rate from my older PC, and while I will admit that the visuals are outstanding, I just can't enjoy the gameplay very much, ESPECIALLY after having to repeat the same segment of a mission over and over. God the checkpoints are awful.I don't think this game is for me, and I wanted to offer my opinion on it. I know that most people find it outstanding, and I can almost guarantee that several people will read ""I find it frustrating..."" and then immediately respond with ""git gud"" in the comments, but I can't recommend it at all, not when there are games like DSIII out there.Then again, I was very much in a hate-hate-hate-like relationship with DSIII until I got the hang of its combat system, so there is a chance I just need to tough it out until I find the magic. If anyone else has found that to be the case, let me know. I'd love to be able to recommend this game, and I'd love to be able to like this game.",negative
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"I expected to fall in love with this game. I spent more than 200 hours with Skyrim, about the same with Oblivion. I love fantasy RPGs in general. People I trust recommended it without reservation. After having tried on three separate occasions to get into the game (twice on console, once on PC), there's little doubt it's a titanic achievement. The graphics are wonderful, the gameplay very good-to-excellent. What I've seen of the main story and side stories is intriguing, if not riveting.Let me tell you when I discovered it wasn't for me. The main quest at one point takes you into a very small hamlet - no more than an inn and a few houses. As Geralt rides into town, there is a group of soldiers outside one home accosting the farmer who lives there. They say to the farmer, in no uncertain terms, that they know he is hiding his daughter from them and they'll keep coming back until they find her and gang rape her. I closed out the game and haven't been back.The world of the Witcher 3 is majestic, sprawling and fascinating. It's also one of the darkest atmospheres I've ever encountered in a game. Corpses hang from trees on the side of the road. Soldiers murder civilians with impunity. There's a side quest early in the game that ends with someone being summarily executed by hanging. There is sorrow, pain, suffering and loss everywhere you look. It's utterly engrossing and I was utterly unequipped to deal with it.I have played violent games. I have played sad games. I have played dark games. But the Witcher 3 showed me something different. The world you inhabit is beyond hope or repair. It is fractured, cruel and uncaring. I turn to games for escapism. The real world can be brutal and sometimes it helps to inhabit someone else who can make a real difference for people, even if the people in question are digital and my actions, in reality, are meaningless. In the Witcher's world, you can struggle to be good, but regardless of your efforts, things don't tend to have a happy ending, or even a decent one.I felt as though nothing I did ultimately mattered and regardless of how badly I wanted to love the game, I just couldn't get over that hump. This game, more than any other I've played, plunges you into a world that epitomizes the term ""war-torn"". It pulls no punches and spares no one. You feel it viscerally.This game is a masterpiece. This game is unpalatable to me. If you read this and decide to play through it, I hope sincerely that you love it as much as I wanted to, but based on my experience I just can't recommend it.",negative

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"The Witcher 3 is hands down my favourite game of all time. I am in love with this game. Playing it feels like being at home, I could've never imagined this would be the game of all games I'm giving a negative review to, due to the abhorrent, stillborn facelift this game received.PerformanceI don't know where to start, stutters? bad performance? lazy graphical updates? broken shaders? crashes? memory leaks? the countless glitches? some features removed and added only to the DX12 wrapper version? This used to be simultaneously one of the best looking games in existence and one of the best performing ones on PC, now it feels like a run of the mill modern PC port chock full of stuttering, complete with the signature bad performance in cities that the old gen version was very surprisinglyfreeof. On my relatively high end PC (3080, R5 3600x, 16gb of DDR4 3200mhz) I get ~45 FPS on the DX12 version with DLSS balanced (this game is in such a hilariously bad state that lowering DLSS internal resolution made the game iteratively run worse for me), with a target resolution of 4K. Lowering to 1440p seems to yield somewhat stable 60-70 frames per second.GlitchesThere's glitches galore, some were fixed over several patches. I started the game last month and was surprised to see that Geralt was still locking out of movement for a solid second everytime he stops, though this was fixed now. There are broken shaders as well - especially for water puddles, when viewed from certain angles they will look like smooth concrete or something like that. There are also numerous bugs that haven't been fixed from the old version (corpses being launched into outer space after enemies finish their death animation, among others).Lazy graphical faceliftCDPR claimed in the past that Witcher 3 was completely hand-crafted, and I'm inclined to believe it even though the veracity of their often bombastic claims has become questionable in recent years. The game was so detailed and unique everywhere, to my eternal adoration, free of lazy corners. Every small area had identity. You could be riding through a dense wood in the corner of a map along a small trail, and then a thin felled tree will block the road, forcing you to take a detour through the dense underbrush, small touches like this add a lot of character to a game's world, and require not only expense from the developers - but it also cannot come from developers who do not have their heart into it. This has beencompletelythrown out the window in the next-gen upgrade; the previously hand-placed foliage has been completely replaced with texture map based procedurally generate foliage, and they didn't bother to even at least move in and fine-tune the new look, so now you have things like bushes floating above small hills, grass growing out of a small camp fire, trails nearly completely covered by grass, that transition of smaller roadside foliage to taller grass blades in fields/forests is gone, among other things.I won't write about the development status of this ""upgrade"", even though it had a lot of bad omens up to its release for those who were following it, and its release launch was announced like a couple weeks before launch, clearly CDPR, who promised a 2022 launch for the next-gen ""upgrade"" which right now feels like a gigantic, unstable fort of planks glued and duct-taped together, have not learned one whit of humility from their last infamous launch, and are doomed to repeat that mistake in the future.",negative

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"Since the so called next gen update the game is unplayable , wont even launch , leave it to CDPR to mess up on e of their best games",negative
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"Was an amazing game, but the new update has royally messed it up. Their DX12 implementation is terrible, with awful performance, and DX11 isn't too much better. On top of that, they removed HBAO+ as a graphics option, so shadows without using RT look that much worse. Honestly, right now they have royally messed up their own game, and if you want to experience a better version of the game you can load the old version in the Beta branch and manually install the mods they put in, even though you miss out on some of the other improvements they made. (although CDPR also didn't fix some of the issues related to the mods, they just left the bugs that came about from the mods in there)This just feels super lazy. They should not have released this update on the PC in this state. I've seen people with 4090's trying to tell me performance is okay because they're able to get around 100 FPS using DLSS3. If you need a $1,600+ video card running a technology that creates fake frames to increase FPS to get 100 FPS in a 7 year old game, there is a problem. I did a test of the old version vs DX12 (that has all the new features), matching up the settings at Ultra as close as I could without any RT.In a spot in town with the old version I got 148 fps vs 69 fps with DX12 in the new version. At a spot by the Hanging Tree I got 133 fps with the old version vs 94 fps with the new version. And that doesn't factor in all the hitching, stuttering massive random FPS drops with the new version. FSR doesn't make much difference and I hear from people with Nvidia cards that DLSS 2 also doesn't really help with performance, which indicates there is some sort of deeper performance issues. I've watched some videos showing that CDPR did basically the laziest implementation of DX12 possible, something along the lines of using a wrapper on DX11 or something.Ryzen 7 5800X3DRX 680032gb DDR4-3600m.2 SSDEDIT: The hotfixes have helped a bit with my FPS in DX12 and smoothed out most of the hitching/stuttering. Once CDPR adds HBAO+ back into the game I'll switch this to a positive review.I also noticed the game will randomly crash mostly during cutscenes or transitions from cutscenes into gameplay.  I don't remember this being an issue years ago before the update. It seems if I completely turn off the overclock on my GPU it mostly fixes the crashing, although it's unfortunate because the game is now harder to run than it used to be with the same settings, so not running an OC on my GPU, that seems otherwise completely stable the last few years I've been using the OC in other games I played, isn't great.",negative
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"The latest update has completely ruined the performance for me. From a stable 60fps on 1080p on HIGH settings to 20-30fps with the same settings. Now, on top of the low FPS, it is also crashing to desktop randomly while playing. They ruined a perfectly functional game which was running without any issues until now.

I tend to play mostly PC games.  I also bounce around between games A LOT.  I may purchase a $60 game and play it for 2 hours or spend $10 on a game and spend 50 hours on it.  Even if I played a game a short time, it does not mean it is bad.  It just means another game caught my attention.  I also complain about flaws in games a lot, even about the littlest of things.

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"The Witcher 3 is a good game for some people, however I am not one of them. Everytime I tried to pick it up again I would immedietly get bored because nothing drew me in. The graphics are great, and the soundtrack is amazing, but I find the quests to be boring and unoriginal, the characters to be bland, and the combat isn't for me, though I can see why people like it.Probably the thing that i dislike the most is that in fantasy games such as this, I like to have complete control over my character and choose how he/she develops, however in The Witcher 3, you are unable to do this as you are always going to play as Geralt, which I suppose isn't the games fault, just my personal preference.Overall I think the game is fantastic for the appropriate audience, but I think I'm just gonna stick to the Elder Scrolls for my fantasy rpg needs.",negative
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"So I'm at 60 hours now. That's long enough to feel you get the game, right?To me, it's just a few spams of jump out, use igni, jump in. Sometimes not even that much.It's easily one of the prettiest games I've ever played. And I keep thinking the story  might get good enough to finish. But I beat witcher 1 and 2 because they were fun enough to get to that point. But for me witcher 1 was more fun than 2, and 2 was more fun than 3. I know I'm in the minority, but it just doesn't take much skill, even on harder settings, and the cut scenes get out of hand. So many of them.I've been told by many that this game defines what an RPG should be. Strange, because I feel like it's barely an RPG at all. Yes, there's gear, but it hardly matters. Yes, there are spells, but it just makes the game easier when it wasn't hard to begin with. I just don't get it, and maybe that's me, but it really isn't very good. The best part are the snippets of writing, but it's not as verbose as the stuff in Skyrim. You don't have reason to use your imagination like you do in other games.So if you liked Witcher 1 and finished 2, but feel the same way I did about those, maybe you'll find this is not really worth your time.Just my two cents!Updated, cause there are still fanboys crying about silliness they don't seem to understand.The combat ISN'T fun combat. It's less complicated than any other RPG I can name. It's not that I want a combat only game, as some might say. I want interesting combat, and a challenge. I want a REASON to want new gear. None of that mattered in this game. Gear was irrelevant, and skill wasn't required. The ONLY thing stopping you from fighting things several levels outside your range was merely an artificial wall where your strikes suddenly won't do more than 1 damage. You can still win - after about 45 minutes of fighting the same thing... But only because the mob was being denied you by a poor system for handling it. Skill still wasn't required, even when it highly outleveled you.So if you want to enjoy a gear/level up system because it makes your character feel like he has a reason to level - then look somewhere else. Fanboys, just deal with the facts. It's the truth.",negative
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"This game is a really good example of how having a lot of content is not necessarily a good thing. With this game in particular, a lot of content can be bad if the core gameplay starts stagnating.You play as Geralt, whose job it is to hunt monsters. So obviously the core gameplay of this game is the combat and the fun of the combat, if graphed, would look like an upside-down parabola: It starts off bad, gets more and more fun over time, reaches a tipping point, and then starts dipping.So when you start the game, you're a complete noob and can die in like 3-4 hits. You don't know how to properly fight enemies and are figuring everything out. It feels bad, but as you learn, you slowly get better and enemies that were previously a huge challenge become manageable. This feeling of progression feels really good. In fact, you have a lot of offensive abilities at your disposal:â¢ Light Attackâ¢ Heavy Attackâ¢ Special Light Attack (Whirlwind)â¢ Special Heavy Attack (Rend)â¢ Crossbow (Damage and knock flying enemies onto the ground)â¢ Igni (AOE Fire damaging spell)â¢ Aard (AOE Stun / knock flying enemies onto the ground)â¢ Axii (Super Strong INDIVIDUAL stun)â¢ Yrden (AOE Slowdown / make ghosts vulnerable)The above are a lot of options at your disposal, and knowing which of your abilities / attacks to use against which enemies is a lot of fun in the beginning. There is also a lot of different enemy variety in the game, so this challenge of mastering what approach to use against enemies will last a good amount of time.The problem with the combat is that you get too overpowered way too quickly. You know how I said that the fun is like an upside-down parabola? Well, the peak of the parabola is around 18-20. That's when you unlock all of your abilities and encounter most of the enemies. After this point though, all those abilities you unlocked start becoming irrelevant because 1 ability in particular starts overshadowing ALL of them: Igni. See, in this game, there's a stat called ""Sign Intensity"" and it upgrades your spells. With Igni, as you get more sign intensity, the chance to inflict ""burn"" increases. When an enemy is ""burning"", they don't attack you, and they take a PERCENTAGE of their MAXIMUM health as damage every secondâ¦â¦.. And you can reach 100% burn chanceâ¦â¦â¦ So with 90% of enemies, the optimal strategy becomes to Igni them, wait until it comes off cool-down (and you don't have to dodge or anything while waiting since the enemies are basically stunned. It's also a bad idea to even hit them because they'll stop burning), Igni again, repeat until enemies are deadâ¦â¦. So you know how I listed 9 different abilities at your disposal. Well, after level 18-20, the following are effectively what you'll be using since the other abilities are irrelevant:â¢ Igni (90% of enemies)â¢ Special Heavy Attack (Rend - because it's unblockable and for those enemies that can't be burned / have high magic resistance)â¢ Yrden (Make ghosts vulnerable. You don't care about the AOE Slowdown)â¢ Crossbow (Knock flying enemies onto the ground. You don't care about the damage)And the 10% of enemies that were not susceptible to Igni, they simply weren't all that fun to fight. See, the challenge of this game clearly comes from fighting multiple groups of enemies at once, and every single type of enemy that comes in swarms is susceptible to Igni. When fighting 1 on 1, the combat becomes overly simple. You can think of 1 on 1 combat as a turn based affair. When you attack enemies 2-3 times, they will ""dodge"" or ""counter"" or something, and then attack you back since now it's their ""turn"". After that though, you can attack them 2-3 times again since it's now your ""turn"". So with every single 1 on 1 fight, the combat is the following:â¢ Hit enemies 2-3 times, dodge backwards and wait for enemy's ""turn"" to finish, hit enemies 2-3 times, repeat.The above even works on BOSSES, so yea the combat of this game can get incredibly stale.I think most people would say at this point to simply stop using Igni if it's THAT overpowered. I tried that, but that doesn't make the game any more fun because I never felt like I was at a risk of dying. That's because not only is Igni broken, but so are the defensive options available to you:â¢ Heals: You heal in this game by eating food or drinking potions. This is automatic in the sense that once you press the button, you start regenerating health. Geralt doesn't have a drinking/eating animation or anythingâ¦â¦ so you effectively have regenerating health. The only limit is how much food/potions you have, and they're both dirt cheap so yeaâ¦.. Effectively regenerating health in all combat situations.â¢ Dodge: You can literally spam dodge and avoid damage as long as you're spamming dodge. The invulnerability frames are THAT generous. The only way to take damage while spamming dodge is that you dodge TOWARDS the attack, in which case you'll take a hit. But otherwise you can just spam dodge and wait for your health to regen to full. I think the best example of how ridiculous this is is that there's some enemies who'll do a ""Charge"" attack at you. To avoid it, you can spam dodge BACKWARDS, (not sideways) and still avoid it. See, the enemy is charging at you, clearly hitting your face for a full 3 seconds, but you'll still avoid damage by dodging backwards for the entire 3 seconds (the only way to take damage is to dodge TOWARDS the enemyâ¦â¦..)â¢ Quen: One of your magic abilities is a ""bubble"" that blocks 1 hit. Even if the hit would kill you, it'll completely nullify the damage from that 1 hit. In the beginning, you can only place this bubble on yourself once every 6 seconds. However, at level 11, you can use it every 3 secondsâ¦â¦. So yea at this point you basically can't dieâ¦.. (remember how I said that you can die in like 3-4 hits? Well as you progress, it takes like 7-8 hits to kill youâ¦.. So yeaâ¦.. You're not going to die)â¢ Guard/Counterattack: No need to use this since the above 3 will carry you for the entire gameSo even if you didn't use Igni, combat would just be about using Quen, hitting enemies, if you mess up, use Quen again, repeat. Again, you could not use Quen in addition to not using Igni, but then combat would just be about dodging around until your health comes back. By not using the specific abilities, you're just making combat last LONGER, but it never really becomes CHALLENGING, which is the main flaw of the game.In regards to the story, there's really nothing much to talk about. The main story is about Geralt trying to find Ciri (his daughter). He finds her, then they have to fight the people chasing her. They do, and the story endsâ¦.. The main problem with the main story is that I have no reason to CARE about any of these characters. There is no character development going on. I don't understand Geralt's motivations apart from he cares about Ciri. I don't understand Ciri's motivations apart from she's tired of running and wants to take a stand. What sacrifices have these characters had to make? Do they have any regrets in life? Why do they care about one another? I am pretty sure all the character development happens in the books, so to really enjoy the story, you have to read the books. Not play the 1st and 2nd game, but read the books. The 1st and 2nd game have pretty much nothing to do about Ciri (who is the main driving factor of the 3rd game).Before finding Ciri, there are some side stories. Some of them are mildly interesting, but the best story in my opinion is definitely the Bloody Baron story. This is the 1st main side story and I was completely hooked to this story until the very end. This was a perfect example of good character development. It's unfortunate that the same wasn't done for the main charactersâ¦..If the game ended near level 18-20, then the game would've been a really fun time. Unfortunately, it dragged on for far longer than needed.",negative

I had the same mods installed that the update contains.Right now I can play the game in 1080p with 50fps on medium to high settings + DLSS quality (which looks absolutely horrible).I understand that the purpose of DLSS is to reduce the rendering quality + resolution to lower the overall visual quality and exchange the quality with blurry and sharpening effects so game developers can get away with bad optimized games and Nvidia can sell it as a cool ""KI feature"".This update is good for next-gen consoles I guess but for PC users it looks like an ad to buy a RTX4090 to play a 7 year old game again.For me the game is not enjoyable to play with the update.

OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom Edition,"TL;DROPUS: Echo of Starsong is among the best releases this year. Its story combined with stunning visuals and gorgeous music will most certainly melt your heart and make you cry. It also provides a serviceable resource management game loop to keep you engaged while visiting each location and exploring lore of the world.Here are some extra points:VisualsActually, not much to add. Look at the screenshots and all I can tell you is that the game just looks that great.MusicThose piano notes are absolute masterpiece. The main theme just gives me chills whenever it hits.GameplayThe main game loop revolves around managing your fuel while travelling between space stations and asteroids. Though there are random events and skill checks at play, the game is pretty forgiving in this regard. This is no FTL.Some puzzles are involved while exploring locations, but they are never hard enough to pose any challenge.Iâd say the mechanics are mostly there to keep you actively engaged without the game turning into full blown walking simulator or visual novel.StoryOPUS: Echo of Starsong is a story told through a series of flashbacks. As you travel in the world, youâll delve more into the history of each character and the world itself.Iâd rather not spoiler main story beats so let me tell you this much: The game tries very hard to immerse you into its world. Every descriptive text is another lore shown, much like how From Softwareâs works were done. (Pretty crazing comparing these two, huh?)And Iâd say theyâve done an astonishingly good work in building an unusually designed universe. The best I can describe it is an oriental flavored Star Wars which doesnât lean much into hardcore sci-fi, and its uniqueness intrigues me to explore more of it at all times during my gameplay.Technical IssueAll above that make the game great are fortunately not overshadowed by its technical issue.Iâve encountered a game breaking issue midway during my initial playthrough, but the devs quickly responded and worked with me in identifying the problem. Since then the bug has been fixed with a progression hard lock so I have updated my review to reflect this change.Here are some extra hiccups to note though:The game runs at a weird 36fps (probably due to me using a 144Hz monitor) on my extremely powerful machine. Thankfully the gameplay doesnât particularly demand high framerate, but it is indeed jarring.There are no anti-aliasing available for some reason, which is a shame for screen capturing this otherwise beautiful piece.No option to go 4K, currently capped at 1440p which also worsens graphics a bit if you are running on a 4K display.All in all, a solid 10/10 for those who love atmospheric adventure game, story heavy exploration game, and maybe just whoever enjoys soothing visuals and music.",positive

OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom Edition,"âThe Galaxy is Vast and Yet Fate Brings Us Together.âIâve to admit that I never play previous title of OPUS series. Visual and soundtrack from preview are first two things that grab my attention and decide to give it a try. After the credits roll, itâs hard to describe this sleeping hit in few words, but Iâm really glad to experience and cover this gem.OPUS: Echo of Starsong (EoS) is linear story-driven adventure game developed by Taiwanese team SIGONO. This subjective review is written based on version 1.4.3 which might address most previous issues.Our Name Was Known Across the StarsEoS storytelling is strongest part and best to experience blindly from the beginning as I want to minimize the context in story section. The OPUS series shares the same universe, but each story is standalone and completion.The aftermath of galactic war caused by factions to claim ancient power of Lumen civilization, the journey of a man who intent to bring honor back to his clan by claiming Lumen cave under his name, and wandering young girl who can sense Lumen asteroids by imitating Starsongs. This is story of fate and destiny of two people echoing across solar system named Thousand Peaks.The journey filled with hope, dedication, and responsibilityA Screenshot of OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom EditionBy:DinnyforstEos is an emotional narrative of space journey and memorable casts driven by strong motive and personality. Most are mainly represented in text-based form with visual background. Various events and screenplay gives fair time to slowly build character development even the pacing is sometimes quite fast and shifts between flashback and present. You might expect foreshadowing from the prologue, but the story still has element of surprise and mysterious. It also centers on character relationship which feels much more personal and emotionally attached from the beginning to the end.Thousand Peaks is also full of different kind of people suffered or traumatized by war and mysterious of Lumen civilization. The Myrian mythology of Lumen set an interesting and complex world background that well integrates and deeply connects to the main story. Amount of information and poetry form might be overwhelming and require time to invest. Once it clicks and comes together, it genuinely feels rewarding and positively satisfying to be that way.The contrast between fantasy and sci-fi element and writing that carefully craft and merge together. The ideology of afterlife, consciousness, morality, responsibility, and life lesson are some parts I learn and appreciate from the playing the game. Those elements simply create one of most beautiful and memorable story Iâve experienced in indie title so far.The Arts of Thousand PeaksIndie games usually take art direction in compensate for graphic quality. The game assets are simplistic and low-poly blocky artstyle, but surprisingly amazed by their complexity when it comes to Myrian architecture and spacecraft / station aesthetic that represent background history and culture of Thousand Peaks' habitants.Beautiful hand-drawn 2D illustration and composition create strong character expression and easy to follow from heartwarming to intense moment. Big props to artist and 3D team!Together with Red ChamberEoS is a game of journey with combination of side-scrolling adventure, puzzle, and space expedition. The game shifts between different gameplay in order to refresh the change of pace and diversity. Side-scrolling section usually triggers in main story progression as player takes control of main characters and either interact environment or solve the puzzle to progress through story.Simple puzzle and mini-game but integrated to lore and setting very wellA Screenshot of OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom EditionBy:DinnyforstMost of puzzles are tuning different Starsongs to match the pattern or interact in correct sequence. Some might require clue, but they are pretty straightforward and very forgiving. It might lack challenge in exchange for casual friendly and fitting focused narrative.Space expedition also plays a big part in EoS. Player can explore various optional places (space station, Lumen cave, and planet) to scavenge resource or gather piece of information (memories) to learn more about Thousand Peaks. However, every action costs your resource (for example: amount of fuel consumed by distance or use exploration kit for random resources). Moreover, player also encounters various events when approaching new location ranging from small decisions to roll-dice event that may cause harm to your ship. The key is to plan your route and always trade sellable items for money to repeat and expand the new area.Discover various places of Thousand Peaks and changes after galactic war.A Screenshot of OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom EditionBy:DinnyforstThe expedition emphasizes on preparation and resource management. It gives a strong sense of unpredictable space journey under inspiration of tabletop adventure and representation of Lumen War aftermath.A Rough JourneyTabletop RNG element might offer an unpredictable experience in first playthrough, but it could be frustrating and create unnecessary extra layer of resource grinding or disrupt the flow of storytelling.The problem is most memory collectables are tied to specific choice (or success dice roll) in every event. The dialogue choice doesnât completely change or impact the story other than slightly different set of conversation and achievement, making one choice is always superior to the other. The lore information you read and interpret from memories help to fulfill the whole picture of the story and I personally think it shouldnât be messed by uncontrolled RNG event (some items can enhance luck, but worst case still happens) and choice could at least affect fate of side characters.The single-slot auto save system also means action canât be reversed and easily to mess up. As a linear story-driven game, I could understand the purpose of creating different experience for some players, but look into some designs; it feels self-contradictory and way more punishing especially for completionist and perfect run achievement.Audio / SoundtrackEach track in EoS are beautifully and well composed by Triodust. It has variation genre which fit each scenario or main location player are visit; sense and feeling of adventure, departure, pushing, and hope along the journey.The vocal part voiced by Cikado is also beautiful haunting especially Starsongs that the artist imitates and reflects one of main protagonist inner thoughts. Once the story and visual set up the direction, the music will do its part and exceed my expectation to emotional level.Performance / Technical AspectEoS is powered by Unity Engine (2019.4.3). The game runs smoothly with solid performance (Win 7, GTX 1050 Ti, 8GB RAM, 1080p resolution). Display type and resolution are only graphical option and the game doesnât have key binding feature, but itâs doable due to its simple control scheme and friendly UI design.The game lengths between 7-10 hours on first playthrough depended on your pacing / reading and offers chapter replayablity for100% collectable. The game is functional and I havenât encountered any game breaking bugs or crash so far.ClosingEoS holds a very special place in my heart despite some gameplay flaws (at least in my perspective). It deserves more attention and potentially can be a solid animation. If youâre looking for a touching relationship and story rich world with light element of gameplay gimmicks, Echo of Starsong is one of absolute choice of experience that might emotionally inspire you and many more.If you found this review helpful, please consider and give a thumb up.

This is the reason I love indie gaming so much. Every now and again you discover a true masterpiece, and this is one.Everything about the game personifies quality; The story is memorable, touching and emotional; the characters are well developed and cleverly woven into story plots; the visuals are impressive and the sound design is absolutely amazing. It really does have the whole package.This game will appeal to a wide audience although it will mostly attract visual novel and adventure fans. Personally, I donât tend to like visual novels but you will find heavy influences embedded in the game. Character interactions evolve through dialogue text yet you never feel overwhelmed by content. Conversations bounce between cast members like a game of tennis, rarely stopping long enough to bore or annoy. Discussions are punchy and short yet manage to retain meaningfulness and cleverly build layers on characterâs personalities and relationships.The story is incredibly emotional, thanks in part to the wonderful script and character development, but elevated and augmented by the stunning soundtrack and special effects.It is amazing in places and creates such tension and drama that it has you engrossed in events. The story of Eda is based around sound but it gathers new meanings as you progress through the adventure.I thought the story dipped a little in the middle due to the amount of space travel you have to perform. The places you visit can feel a little aimless sometimes yet fans of lore will absolutely love it. The background of the war, the different factions and how Lumen affected the solar system is all explained in detail and provides a thick blanket of knowledge.The presentation of the story is sublime. It is obvious that a lot of time went into developing and executing the story. It goes in so many different directions and is constantly being built up. Events are depicted in a variety of different ways to keep things fresh including flashbacks and dialogue exchanges to exploration and discovery.There are numerous opportunities to stretch your legs and search different locales including Lumen caves and space stations. The caves are relatively linear, but there is scope to explore and collect items to sell for profit, in exchange for maintaining and upgrading your ship; There are light puzzle elements involving opening star gates and Lumen related tasks; There are a few action sequences about and some emotional cut scenes; There are dialogue choices which affect story, relationships, ship and crew.The game is full of variety.Travelling around the solar system can be a little daunting to begin with. You need to manage your fuel levels, shields, exploratory packs and money, and sometimes it is difficult to know which places you have visited before. The story tends to push you in a certain direction, so if you want to explore, do it whilst you can, as you wonât have the opportunity to return after the game has finished. I found this a little annoying as I wanted to mop up some achievements but was unable to.Overall, it is one of the best indie titles I have played and I am sure it will earn many accolades.ð¹ï¸Gameplayð¹ï¸Gameplay consists of Exploration, Ship management, light puzzle elements and dialogue choices.Upgrading your ship enables you to travel further, sustain more damage and carry out more explorations. Vital later in the game.A Screenshot of OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom EditionBy:janner66ExplorationYou can explore the area of Thousand Peaks in your space ship, landing at various ports or asteroids. A map of the area is displayed and you can visit any destination visible if you have enough fuel and the scanner is within range. During the journey you can sometimes explore debris using your exploratory packs. These might unearth some goodies for you to use or sell.Each destination will have characters to interact with depending on the type of place you visit. You may have decisions to make which can affect story plots, future relationships or just determine whether you get out of a certain situation without harm.These places can provide a welcome trading post for you to sell or buy much needed items to replenish or upgrade your ship.In some sectors there are starsongs which Eda can detect and sing. Once recorded she can ask Jun to visit its origin and explore the caves it is harbored in.Ship managementManaging the ship you will need fuel, protective panels, exploratory kits and money.Each time you travel to a destination you use fuel; If you encounter enemies or asteroid fields your ship might get damaged and use up panels; Exploratory kits are needed to detect items and cash is needed to buy certain items including replenishing the above items.Dialogue ChoicesThere are numerous occasions where you need to decide on an answer. Sometimes these are straight choices affecting plots and relationships whilst others are more luck orientated. Throwing dice will determine the outcome but your chances can be increased by finding certain items with luck enhancers.There are some touching moments in the game. The relationship between Eda and Jun is a pleasure to watch unfold.A Screenshot of OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom EditionBy:janner66Puzzle elementsEda must complete a small puzzle to resonate her starsong correctly by listening to the song and centering parts of the song until it sounds correct. Jun needs to complete an alignment puzzle to open star gates, explore the caves to find the starsongs, and activate lumium pipes. The puzzle elements can be seen in the gameplay video.ðº Graphics ðºVisuals are excellent. I didnât particularly like the over-the-top expressions the characters made during conversations though. I know it is a staple of visual novels but it just seemed out of place.I took far too many screenshots. That just about says it all.ðµSound ðµAbsolutely amazing. Whilst editing my gameplay video I noticed all the wonderful sound effects and background noises you donât necessarily notice when playing. Headphones are a must to fully appreciate the sounds on offer. The story revolves around sound and it is a central element in everything OPUS does well.ð³ Conclusionð³OPUS: Echo of Starsongis a superior narrative adventure and I would argue one of the best in the genre.There is much variety in the gameplay but generally it is quite slow and dialogue heavy so it will appeal to narrative adventure fans and visual novel enthusiasts.If you like a good story full of drama, twists and excellent character development then I sincerely recommend you give this a go. It is excellent value at full price.",positive

Both are from different walks of life, but together they are able to use their differences to complete their goal. Travelling around on their ship, they search for a much sought after resource called lumen. In the recent past, lumen was the reason for many wars, and the death of many civilisations. Not only this, but certain people called âwitchesâ were conscripted in the war, due to their innate ability to seek it out, and now are looked down upon for their past involvements.  There are so many different elements to the story that it is rather complicated to surmise, however the developers do a brilliant job of simplifying as much as possible, without sacrificing their creativity by making extra game lore accessible to those who search for it.A chance encounter brings the two protagonists together, and everything develops from there. The story is remarkably beautiful, melancholic, and thrilling all at the same time. Considerable effort has gone into creating these characters, developing their backstories and truly bringing them to life. Despite the game being predominantly a visual novel, there is an abundance of unspoken words between the characters that is only known due to the excellent writing. Once more is known about their pasts and seeing their memories, suddenly their current actions and attitudes towards one another fall into place. This happens without overly simple player-handholding and overexplaining, but occurs naturally.OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom EditionA Screenshot of OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom EditionBy:Mz CookiesGameplayBeing a visual novel, there is plenty of text to read, from the characters conversations, to the item descriptions and other story building lore. However, Echo of Starsong does not just stick to this method of storytelling. Instead, it mixes up gameplay with unique audio puzzles, space minigames, resource management, ship upgrades, and even side-scrolling exploration. Whilst the game relies on autosaving, I did wish to be able to travel back to specific chapters to further explore the area, but was not able to do so. I can only assume that there is no manual saving or chapter select to push players to experience the story as a cohesive one, playing only bits and pieces takes away from the goal of the game. However, a chapter select still would have been a nice addition once the game is completed.Majority of the time is spent in The Red Chamber, Edaâs vessel. This ship is used to explore the galaxy by visiting asteroids, other factions or settlements to gather lumen and other resources. Travelling to different locations uses fuel, which there is a limited supply of. It can be bought from various vendors, as can other much needed equipment such as armour plates. Sometimes, during exploration there are moments of conflict, where players must make a choice. The choices are often balanced on a difficulty scale, and the outcome will depend on how much acquired luck you have. For instance, if trying to mimic another communication signal, and the set difficulty is 7, but that characters luck is only up to 10, this will be a difficult encounter to win as odds are not in your favour. Upon failing, typically armour plates are lost, and you will need to repurchase these at the next vendor. However in the most extreme circumstances it could also result in death. These encounters were so much fun, and it further made exploration all the more enjoyable, searching for items to influence luck for each character. Despite the simplicity of the design, which is ultimately just clicking on unexplored dots on a map to travel there, it felt much more exciting, not knowing what is going to happen along the way. Will something stop you? Will you make the wrong choice? Is luck in your favour?OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom EditionA Screenshot of OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom EditionBy:Mz CookiesSecondly, another major element in the game is exploring caves (asteroids) with Jun. He can pick up plants to sell, find memories which further add to the ever-expanding game lore and it is also where most of the puzzles take place. Similar to the resource management/exploration side of the game, the puzzles are not difficult. They are purposefully simple to keep the game accessible to a broad range of players, but this does not mean they are boring, either. All puzzles are unique and audio based, which are actually able to be completed without using your eyes.Visuals & SoundAlmost identical to the previous games, Echo of Starsong has anime-style visuals and some impressive landscapes in space. Indoor environments are not extremely detailed, but fit the style of the game well.The absolute standout feature of the game, and what brings the story to a swell of emotion, is the unforgettable soundtrack and impressive voice acting (I played with Japanese VO). All throughout the game it is extraordinary, through the witches singing, the pivotal moments of tension, and of course, the ending.  Without this dramatic, but profound audio, the story would not have the hard-hitting impact in which it achieves.Technical & StatsThis game was played using a controller, and with the following PC specs.:AMD Ryzen R5 7600x 5.4 GHz32GB DDR5 5200 CL36 RAMRadeon RX 6800 XT2560x1440 resolutionNVMe 3.0 SSDWindows 10Playtime:10 hoursController Recommended?YesReplayability value:For achievement hunters / completionists only.ConclusionOPUS: Echo of Starsong is a remarkable narrative-adventure, well-deserving of its many accolades and achievements. The tremendous effort and creativity in constructing the elaborate world is jaw-dropping. The narrative embodies the developerâs goal of creating unique, heartfelt experiences, without excessively pushing themes onto players.

One thing Ive recently been struggling to shake off is thefeeling of being useless.  No matter what I try and do, it always ends poorly. So it's back to square one as I partake in this seemingly infinite loop of stagnation and self-deprecation. And this is engraved into the very depths of the storyOpustells. Our Red Chamber crew struggle with the same demons, yet they seem oblivious to that fact.The fear of abandonment and the constant feeling of being useless is present and etched into each of them.They all seek a place to call home, a family of their own, and to be of use to someone they cherish.This piece of dialogue didn't have the right to be this funny. Undeniably the best dialogue in the whole gameCommunity Created Artwork for OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom EditionBy:Sv. ProlivijeAnd the love and care put into each main character is just phenomenal.None feel like your usual stereotypes, here to serve one purpose or check a specific box. They feel like genuine people, people you can sympathize with, understanding their deepest wishes and desires. And I simply loved every second I spent reading and interacting with the plethora of different individuals you'll meet on your escapades in the inhospitableThousand Peeks, as well as the many banter sessions between Jun and Remi you'll bear witness to.Andmy god!is the world brimming with juicy lore. Some may say it's overwhelming. But, not this guy. It's just soo enthralling, and seeking out artefacts and items was enticing as it deepened my knowledge of this unique culture, with the mysterious lumen at the centre of it all. Before we discuss gameplay, just one friendly piece of advice - Due to the story being told from the perspective of old Jun, eachlocation and cave you visit holds valuable tidbits of information about his adventures with Eda. So don't gloss over these small walls of text that greet you at each location, as they add further detail to the painting that isOpus: Echo of Starsong.Me after finishing the gameCommunity Created Artwork for OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom EditionBy:Sv. ProlivijeNow what...Trusting a capybara that talks never ends wellThe gameplay mixesvisual novel-style conversations, casual spaceship managementandlight puzzle work. You'll mostly read lots of text, in your quest for the ever so elusiveBanshee, with an odd chance to stretch your legs and explore the lumen filled caves left by an ancient civilization.The story has no crossroads and is firmly set in stone. But, there are plenty of chance encounters as you move from location to location during your travels acrossThousand Peaks. Usually, you are presented with at least two choices, and one will always havea dialogue check. You'll seldom be asked for an item, such as cash, as more often than nought, you'll attempt to deceive the other party with a signal scramble. This is where the RNG dice roll comes in, reliant on the luck of the person speaking. You can boost it by finding or buying certain items that resonate with your crew.And failing sucks, but such is life -you never know how a situation will play out. Sometimes your good intentions are met with deceit or hostility, as people are unpredictable, and we all roll the dice, one time or another. Looking back on my adventure with the Red Chamber crew, I can comfortably say that each of those risks taken was worth it. They arethe reasonwhy I never grew tired of traversing acrossThousand Peaks. There was always a new piece of the story or lore to uncover, perhaps a quirky encounter to take part in or just a chance to obtain a relic thought lost. But they do rely on the same shtick -offering a helping hand, performing an evasive manoeuvre or scrambling the comms. There really wasn't much variety. But, given how every encounter has unique dialogue, this is but a minor nitpick.Besides using your eyes to make sweet, sweet love to the text on screen, you'll have the opportunity to partake in some casual puzzles, fun mini-games and simple spaceship management.Flying the Red Chamber throughThousand Peekscarries a dose of risk, with frequent patrols, scammers, or just running out of fuel. So, since adventuring can be a dangerous trade, especially when all that stands between you and a barrage of bullets is a signal scramble, you'll need the right equipment for the job. Equipment our dear old Red Chamber doesn't have. Well, not yet, at least. So scavenge far and wide in search of upgrade material to get it in tip-top shape, making your journey throughThousand Peaksthat safer. And don't worry, upgrades are nicely tied to story progression, so you really can not fully deck out Red Chamber if you simply explore the game world even a little. Plus, each item has a hint of where you might find it, which I adore.Fine-tuning Eda's starsong recordings was always fun, and I relished every chance I got to do these puzzlesCommunity Created Artwork for Steam ArtworkBy:Sv. ProlivijeBut when you are not labouring as a makeshift spaceship mechanic, doors with tune based locks will greet you and prevent further exploring of the cave. So, grab Jun's rod, andfine-tune Eda's recorded startsong samplesto get them to resonate with theweird lumen thingamajigs, opening the way forward. And besides DJ-ing Eda's recorded starsong,there are also some fun mini-games, like avoiding space debris or trying to find the next starsong and cave to explore. And all of this was pretty basic and straightforward, with some of the end game puzzles being more ""complex"". Personally, I didn't mind this lack of challenge in the slightest, as it provided a nice change of pace after reading copious amounts of text.Lastly,the game oozes style.It sports an anime style for its 2D art, mostly used for conversation avatars and artwork for crucial story moments, while the 3D low polygon one is used for environments and character models. I loved the facial expression the characters make during a conversation. For some, to me, unknown reason, it just made the whole scene feel alive, and I could hear their voices inside my head. And as sound plays a vital role in both story and gameplay, it's only natural that it's magnificent.The soundtrack especially. It manages to capture the essence of each story moment flawlessly and is a key part of both story and gameplay puzzles. While it usually has a serene and mellow vibe, it can quickly turn lively when the moment calls for it or even sinister, asThousand Peaksholds many secrets, some perhaps best left buried.And with that, it's time to say adieu, so I'll pinch a line from our lovable noble, Jun.Even if it was only for a short time, I enjoyed my stay on the Red Chamber.A giant thank you to Sigono for providing a review key throughBaziZen.If you enjoy this review, come and read more wisdom from theGospel of Sv.

OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom Edition,"It somewhat pains me to rate this negatively because there are a lot of things I did like.  The art style is beautiful, the puzzles are nice, the soundtrack is good, and the gameplay, while simple, is quite engaging.But a game like this lives and dies by its story, and while the setting is original, the characters are so paper thin and poorly characterized that the story as a whole falls flat.  Character A hates Character B, which is mostly conveyed through A saying 'I hate B!' for at least 3/4 of the story, until that arc less resolves than is just forgotten.  Character B immediately abandons their original quest 10% of the way into the game to follow Character C for the repeatedly stated and paper-thin reason that these people they just met 'are my family now!'  This original quest is repeatedly reintroduced as a means to increase tension - will they leave?  Will they stay? - but always by some other character, usually A frantically telling C that B's departure MUST be imminent. But Character B never worries.  They are staying because ""You are my family now!"" which is, more or less, their only motivation for the remainder of the game.  Character C is trying to find Character D, who in flashbacks repeatedly tells Character C to be their own person and go off on their own adventures, but, as you may now see is a repeating theme - Character C does not deviate for a moment.  Character C proceeds to make dumb mistake after dumb mistake on their quest, with those rash decisions being the overwhelming driver of the plot.In a better plot, we'd have character growth.  C would learn to let D go.  B would actually struggle to decide between actual and found family.  A would recognize their feelings towards B as coming from a place of fear as to what B would do to the relationship forged between A and C.  But no, none of that happens.  B abandons their family until the game is over, A hates B until it is just forgotten and C continues to try to find D to catastrophic effect.And its too bad, because, behind it there is a really neat mythology and hidden backstory to some of the characters that I kept hoping would get woven into the main plot at some point - lost heirs, prophesied reincarnations of gods...  I kept pushing aside my annoyance with the plot, confident that this really cool stuff would eventually show up in later acts... but they don't.  By the end of the game I was left just deeply dissatisfied by the whole experience.",negative
OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom Edition,"I actually found the bulk of the game to be mediocre at best. Many of the gameplay segments come across as forced or tedious in a way that artificially extended the length of the game for the sake of simply giving you something to do. For those reasons, there were many times throughout the game where I wanted to uninstall but felt compelled to at least see it through to the ending.  The last 20% of the game is satisfying for the most part. The ending is well executed enough for me to forgive the game's shortcomings. I probably won't be playing the game anytime soon and I still short of regret buying it, but I can't dislike the game for what it is.",positive
OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom Edition,"So this is my first ever steam review and that's for a reason. I usually don't care enough to write a review at all even just a simple number writing with no text. However, this game it's a ride. Emotionally anyways I cried, I laughed, I got angry, I was anxious feeling my heart rate go up, and I was left in shock from a few events that end up happening.Now I just want to state the anxiety this game made me feel isn't something that I have experienced from a video game ever before. Sure other games have kept me on the edge of my seat for a variety of reasons but non quite like this. It isn't scary at all, but it still gave me the same heart pumping feeling of a big monster in say a horror game but not because there's a big scary monster. Rather you know what's going to happen or rather you know the most major thing that ends up happening from the beginning of the game. And then the game takes you on it's ride and you go through each chapter and it's parts if it's a split chapter.  And with each passing chapter you know you're getting closer to that ending that you saw from the beginning. And it isn't like a good book in that you don't want it to end because you can't put it down (although it does that too), it's more so you already know the end but you don't want it to end that way. And so with every bit of emotion I had I wanted the plot to resist it's inevitable ending even though I already knew how it ends because of the characters and the world and wanting the best for each of them. I sincerely wanted for everyone to be happy in the end, and while I won't say the ending is a happy ending it's not a sad ending either, it's more bitter sweet.And so with all this being said I can't recommend this enough whether it be full price or on sale like at the time of my writing this. Please treat yourself and get this if you value good characters, story, a decent world, and an amazing emotional ride.",positive

OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom Edition,"The overwhelmingly positive reviews are well deserved !The world is rich, the characters are relatable, the graphics are pretty, the music works well and the gameplay is good enough (Resources management and puzzles).You basically follow Jun, Eda and Remi in a wonderful journey through the Thousand Peaks and the story is surprisingly well done with good illustrations.You will get enough quality content for the asking price even without a discount. It took me a bit less than 14 hours to finish it, which is enough for the game to tell you what it wants to. I don't plan on 100% achievements, because it is way too easy to miss stuff and the fuel management becomes a little difficult when you want to explore everything, but I enjoyed nearly every minute of it (I found a mini-game a bit annoying to perfect but that is all).In a nutshell, if you enjoy beautiful narrative games, it is an easy recommendation !",positive
OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom Edition,"Wow just wow, these devs are just improving on every subsequent game they release. The first was 2D, the Second was still 2D but better animations and art and now with their 3rd installation, it is now 3D but most of the time locked on 2.5D.Not only the graphics but everything in this game has been upgraded. Just like the 2 previous games, this game has an amazing soundtrack and its story is the best out of all the 3. If you have ever played the first one, you wish that instead of scanning stars, you actually visit them. They have made that a reality in this game and has included a simple yet excellent space travel mechanics with it (Fuel management, random encounters, ship upgrades, etc).The puzzle games involve audio and you have to make it resonate by tuning its frequency and volume so the mechanisms respond to it. This is a first time I've seen this mechanic.This game is totally worth its asking price and I recommend this to anyone. I would even hazard to say that this game is up there with the best emotional games like To The Moon, This War of Mine, Walking Dead. It did not make me bawl like the games I listed but still made me shed a tear. Playtime is around 10 hours or less.Some minor complaints I have is some achievements are missable and I kinda don't feel like replaying for a 2nd playthrough. And the last one is I wish they can include VA on their next game.",positive

OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom Edition,"This game is the 3rd game of the Opus series made by the Taiwanese indie developer Sigono.This time, the game is heavily influenced by the ""Seiho"" (""ææ¹"") anime series (Outlaw Star/Angel Links) and ""Lost Universe"" (from the creator of ""Slayers"") right from the very 1st step we set foot in the game.The story evolves around the ""Galactic Leyline"" (translated as ""Lumen"" in English in the game), is very similar to the same Leyline in ""Outlaw Star"", the part where the miko being the ""navigator"" of the ship is very similar to ""Outlaw Star"" as well... while the exploration and excavation of the ruins is very similar to those in ""Lost Universe"" where human found far advanced technology that's doesn't belong to current human... The major difference is the violence level is near 0 in this game, everything is done in a more pacifist way (apart from blowing up some of the ruins)... So if you liked either of the Seiho Anime or Lost Universe, you will surely fall in love with this game's background setting. Other than the resemblance to Seiho and Lost Universe, the game retained its originality with their own story from the 1st and 2nd Opus games. So we can't really call this a copy-cat or parody game because the writer digested the ideas and made it anew with his own originality to them, so in no way this is an inferior copy of the original ideas.The music of this game really reminds me of the Taiwanese game""Princess Banenn(å·´å·å¬ä¸»)""which is based off real Taiwanese native tribes legend, and thesongsin the game uses the old native song mixed with modern musical instruments resulting in something very similar to the ""New age"" songs in the west but this one's from the East. And with time passed, with better electrical musical instruments and all that... the song in this game has surpassed the ""heart touching"" level Princess Banenn once gave me decades ago... It's similar but way better in quality, and definitely something that's able to touch the soul of the player.The game play, is very similar to the 1st Opus (The day with found Earth) merges with the 2nd Opus (Rocket of Whispers) in total with additional micro-management added. And since the 2nd Opus already gave a very similar feel to the game ""Outer Wilds"", this 3rd game here gives out that feeling too. To be frank, although not as immersive as ""Outer Wilds"". i prefer Opus Echo of Starsong far more. A job well done!But is the game really perfect? Well, honestly, I've tried to play this in multiple languages to get a hold of the story in all the perspective... And i found out even in their original Traditional Chinese version, a lot of the dialog are cut-off in a weird way, probably an adjustment to fit in the game's limited dialog box. So there should be an original longer version of the writing but it got trimmed during the game development. And to be honest, in the end, it's the Japanese version that ended up with a higher emotional level in story telling due to Japanese have a way more colorful way to express emotion in words (but the Japanese version gets more trimmed off part due to translation and dialog box fitting), while the Chinese version has more curses and swear words when they try to portrait these emotional feeling, which actually didn't reach the emotion level as high as the Japanese version imo... and as always, the English version falls flat when it comes to this kind of expression... So if you are multi-lingual like me, and wondered which version to go for the game, my advice is to play the game in Traditional Chinese while using the Japanese voice over, so you get to compare the 2 and it instantly replenish the trimmed out part.In short, Opus: Echo of Starsong is a great sequel to the original 2 games, a great great improvement indeed. And already the previous 2 games are both a great story teller, this game win by a mile... something we see in a lot of ""3"" in game series... which could prove difficult for them to overcome when making a 4th game. But judging from what we get in this game here, this is naught but a beginning, where the game finally show its own color and able to tell its own lore with a staple universe as background, so i am really looking forward to their next game.",positive

OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom Edition,"Originally, I was actually going to leave a positive review listing the aspects I liked but with a big warning about the ending. But before that, to leave a fairer review I wanted to replay a chapter or two, read the in-game chapter synopses/lore, and watch the ""Behind the Scenes"" unlocked for beating the game.It has now been a few months but I have had zero desire to replay the game; if not for the voice-acting update I wouldn't have even opened the game in that time.When I first finished the game, I thought the ending was bad. With a few months of reflection, I can now say that I was wrong; the ending isn't bad, it's one of the worst I've ever experienced; I've never had a ending so completely invalidate the time I invested into a story.In many ways this game reminds me of Darling in the FranXX. The plot and characters are nothing special, but the worldbuilding is captivating; the designs of costumes, form of technologies, geography of the setting, and other details all combine to lure you in. Then in DitF, the entirety of Episode 19 is a narrator giving a large, steaming dump of exposition systematically killing all sense of mystery. OPUS also adopts a text dump, but not wanting to be outdone, it doesn't kill just suspense by dumping its lore like DitF: it kills its entire narrative by dumping its ending.Really I can sit here picking apart every aspect of the ending, it's like it was carefully constructed to check off every possible don'ts as a strawman example in a writing textbook. While I might do so later as an exercise, for now I'd rather direct people to some good satire on YT about writing endings.""All you need to do is cross the finish line, and not face plant at the end. ...

OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom Edition,"Echo of Starsong: Emotional Beauty. (No Spoilers)There often comes a point in my life where I just want to pick up my controller, relax on my couch and enjoy a good story-driven experience. Iâve played many games in the aforementioned type, but only a handful of them manage to really touch my heart and make me emotionally invested in their narratives. OPUS: Echo of Starsong is one of those. Itâs an adventure-filled, mysterious and heartwarming tale about acceptance and closure. But before I go any further with my review, there are a bunch of things you should know to get an idea of what to expect:1.	This is an indie title made by a team of twenty developers.2.	The story is (very) heavily emphasized upon through text, although it is notentirelya visual novel.3.	âGameplayâ is a feature with enough variety to keep things from becoming stale. May get boring or frustrating for some people.4.	It shares the âOPUSâ title with the other games Rocket of Whispers and The Day We Found Earth, but theyâre independent stories so you donât have to worry about playing them first.If the above facts donât matter to you, or youâre someone who just wants to experience an extremely well written story without any kind of grindy, mission-based structure, then you donât need to read any more of this review. Just go ahead and buy this game immediately at full price because itâs totally worth it!Having said that, brace yourselves for an in-depth review.Gameplay:The gameplay in EoS is diverse in its own right. Itâs a visual novel, a 2.5-D side-scroller, a mini RPG, a strategy-based open-world explorer, and even has a bit of âSpacewar!â without weapons. Itâs really fun if you dive into the game without expecting any kind of gameplay at all except for single button-presses. Having said all these, it may pose as a contradiction that the core gameplay is very linear and restrictive, but let me explain.Character movement is very limited during cave exploration and the level design is filled with invisible walls. Also, numerous dialogues pop in between your exploration very often and stop you from moving. It improves a lot as the game progresses (or maybe I got used to it), but it can be off-putting during the initial moments.Youâre given a spaceship which you can upgrade different parts of, but itâs barebones and lacks in detail. You search for hidden relics and items with Exploration Kits, earn and spend money to manage your fuel and armor, and perform various side missions that are all part of the lore and provide important context regarding the world youâre in. Thereâs quite a bit of strategy involved and it kept me engaged the entire time.Opening gates inside caves and other structures, and tuning starsongs can get repetitive for some, although I enjoyed doing it. Sound has a key role here, and if youâre unsure about what your eyes see, you can always trust your ears.Despite some very noticeable flaws, I mostly enjoyed what the gameplay had to offer, mainly because I didnât expect it to be any more than just a point-and-click adventure like OPUS: The Day We Found Earth. However, it turned out to be diverse and entertaining enough for me to keep playing it.7/10 in Gameplay.Music:Outstanding. Phenomenal. Unbelievable. Superb. (You see what I did here.)Triodust is a magician.Thereâs not much to say here. EoSâs soundtrack is simply flawless. Rarely do I ever stare at the main menu and listen to the background score. In fact, the music is what got me hooked right from the beginning. It has a variety of moods, ranging from melancholic to uplifting to straight-up chaos, but itâs best that you listen to it for yourself. The music is one of the highlights in Sigono games, and itâs best left to be experienced without any context at all. It stands side by side with The Day We Found Earth in this regard, whose soundtracks I consider to be some of the best in video gaming history.10/10 in Music.Story:The story is told through flashbacks with a LOT of exposition about the lore and setting, which may seem like a downgrade from TDWFEâs natural storytelling, but we have to consider the scale of the game and the development team behind it. Telling the story from ground zero would have lengthened the game to at least double its current playtime and for an independent team of twenty people, itâd have taken a lot more time as well. I was content with whatever was present as Iâm acquainted to reading and I knew what this gameâs method of storytelling was from the beginning, but I can understand if some people donât like it.Echo of Starsong may seem like a love story, but itâs actually a tale about accepting your past and moving on. Jun Lee, our protagonist in the beginning, is the master of the Lee clan and is seemingly looking for his lost friend Eda for sixty-six years. As he explores the ruins of the location where she might be, he reminisces about his past and relives his memories with her and we get to experience them from both perspectives. The narrative tackles various human emotions really well and that is complemented by the well written characters and dialogue. Jun, although a bit naÃ¯ve in the beginning, gets his character developed during the course of the eleven hours of playtime and becomes more relatable. Eda is the best character in the entire game. Sheâs a motivation-driven woman who acts indifferently towards Jun in the beginning, but we get to see her character developed as well, as her true intentions and feelings are brought to light and she comes to terms with her desires and motivations. The side-characters, although well written, would have shone had they been developed with a bit more detail, but Iâm willing to let it slide.The story also tackles various political themes, racial beliefs and moral indecisiveness with precision. Nothing is hammered on to the player through forced dialogue or arguments; itâs just present and makes a point when it has to. This is good writing, which is an ordeal to achieve, especially when dealing with sensitive topics and for that, the game receives merit.The narrative, although extremely well written, has some flaws; one of them being its heavy reliance on flashbacks. Imagine a life-or-death scenario where the main character starts thinking about his past and motivations that drove him to that point and that âhe shouldnât give up just yet.â It feels awfully generic and forced. Thankfully, the number of instances of such events in this game are few, but itâs still annoying when they do occur.Another thing that bothered me a little was the character arc of Remi. Although sheâs a dynamic character, she could have been explored a bit more naturally. Her arc feels rushed and not as immersive as that of Jun, Eda and Kay.With these, and some other noticeable bumps in the narrative which I wonât spoil, it may seem difficult to give it a very good score; however, the game shines so brightly during its final moments that it almost compensates for all of its imperfections. The ending of EoS is full of emotional meaning and perfectly rounds up every point that it tries to make. I will not spoil any of it and suggest that you go experience it for yourself. Itâs so good in fact, that Iâm willing to overlook many of its flawed aspects and appreciate the game for what it is. Echo of Starsong truly deserves a9.5/10 in Story.So, if you want to sit back, relax and enjoy a heartfelt, emotional narrative on a weekend, then buy this game immediately. Itâs one of the best Indie titles Iâve ever played. Good job, Sigono! ð8.75/10 Overall.",positive

The music brings a lot of emotion and even better, the Full Bloom edition upgrade means that you get all story related dialogues fully voiced. This further adds to the experience and enhances immersion. Did I mention that both the Japanese and Mandarin dubs were amazing? Listen to it yourself!All in all, I've enjoyed my experience with OPUS: Echo of Starsong through and through. This game is truly special.Thank you SIGONO INC.Thank you Eda, Jun and Remi.",positive
OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom Edition,"There's so much to like about this game: it's beautiful artstyle, decent storyline as well as it's great sound design. What truly disappoints me is how this game is marketed as a ""puzzle adventure game"" but feels much at home to a visual novel than what was being advertised. Most people here liked it, but it's definitely not a game that I'd enjoy playing until the very end.If you're looking for a game similar to Limbo or Little Nightmares, this ain't it. If you're a visual novel fan, then this might be the game you're looking for.",negative
OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom Edition,"A beautiful experience with great story, deep lore, outstanding music and artworks.The gameplay consist of planet explorations, puzzle solving, try / roll for luck mechanic tailored into this masterpiece.If you're searching for something with deep and emotional story, try this.The soundtracks are definitely worth the purchase. so if you can, get the game with it.10/10 Absolutely Recommended.",positive

OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom Edition,"An endearing and beautiful story that is a must-play for anyone who enjoyscompelling narrativesandcharacter-drivenlife journeys. The vast majority of the writing is fantastic, filled with touching lessons, intricate world-building and expansive lore. One aspect that is appreciated is the auditory approach to puzzles that while having visuals, can be completely solved just by listening. Unfortunately, not all is perfect concerning completion. Some collectibles can be missed in addition to some poorly chosen achievements, such as including a speedrun in a dialogue-heavy game. Though these problems are quite minor in comparison to the breathtaking first experience that is OPUS: Echo of Starsong.",positive

OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom Edition,"This is one of those rare games that feels like it was made with love and care in every pixel, every note of music, and every line of dialogue.Itâs a peaceful, contemplative journey with just enough adventure to keep things exciting. Itâs emotional without being overwhelming and beautiful without being pretentious.",positive
OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom Edition,"I originally played this game on gamepass a while back, but liked it so much that I bought it here too to support the devs.I really, really love this game. The story, characters, music, and visuals are all fantastically done. While it is basically just a visual novel in fancy clothing, the ""Faster Than Light"" style of space traversal/resource management is fairly well done and vastly expands on the world's lore. The lore itself is incredibly interesting, and I found myself visiting star systems and collecting items just to learn more. You are rewarded for doing this as well, since knowing the lore and the in-game mythology changes the context of the story and characters in a way that is much more interesting than without. My only gripe with the story is that I wish they gave more development to some of the side characters. The main trio are fleshed out and you come to like them a lot, but I really wanted to know more about everyone else and their stories. Also, the game play outside of space traversal isn't great, but it isn't bad either; it just gets the job done. It's basically just very basic/linear side-scroll exploration with some simple puzzles thrown in. These sections are  used during major story missions when progressing the plot, and are usually accompanied by a lot of dialogue and/or cutscenes. Again, it just acts as a way to add some more variety to the visual novel format. Not everyone will like them,  but I personally really appreciated these sections and the visuals/music that play during them more than made up for the game play.Anyways, the game for me is a 9/10! It's one of the only video games to ever make me cry, and I really recommend it if you enjoy visual novels. I'm definitely going to play Sigono's other games!!",positive
OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom Edition,"Let me say this before I make my review. If you are not into games that are point and click style 3D adventure games then I wouldn't recommend playing this. The game is very focused on dialogue and scenery meaning that the intense gameplay you might prefer are for the most part uncommon throughout the game. If you do like these games then you can't find anything better than this one and that it a fact.  The game is really good at making you feel with the characters and become invested in the characters decisions and feel in sync with the triumphs and misfortunes plastered throughout the entire game. The pain I felt from the very beginning not only hurt me in every way, but it told me I was in for a world of fun right out the door. The games ship building system although such a minor detail was such a satisfying form of progression as you watch your ship turn from a pile of junk to the sexiest piece of technology the world has ever seen. The puzzles that you have throughout the 3D exploration segments are simple yet fun to do. Hearing the noise of success not only makes me feel like an absolute genius, but also adds to the atmosphere in a way that is super gratifying. In regards to the music I must say that this game has music throughout the entire game that other games dream of ever being capable of achieving. It treats me so well from the good happy times to the times I wish I was dead. The music seems to never wear off with the changes from scene to scene and these seemingly endless flows between pieces that make me wish I was taking a fat nap. In terms of the games length I finished through the first run in a little less than eight hours which is quite a long time for going for only main story. This means there is extra exploration memories that are nice little pieces of extra lore for those who want to find everything and uncover more to the universe of this game. With all of these positives this easily makes this my current favorite game of this year and it will take a lot in order to change that. Needless to say I will be spreading the word to everyone that need to experience the sorrows I have faced.",positive
OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom Edition,"Great immersive story that does not feel rushed or forced with obvious cliches; rather, the pacing is well built with plot development occurring at a natural pace. The motif of the story being told from the protagonist's perspective brings an additional layer to this profound game when exploring different locations and reading the descriptions. Lastly the music is outstanding as it evolves the immersion of the story and events to a whole new level.",positive
OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom Edition,"I mostly picked up this game for the music from the trailer, but the game gave me more than that. It gave me a story to follow and a world to explore. The characters are not the world. They are a small part that makes this world unique. The only thing that I got from this game are genuine tears that I had not shed in the past couple years. It was an amazing experience for how short this game is.",positive

OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom Edition,"This game conveys a beautiful message about trans-temporal connections between individuals who shared memories and emotions. Such a complicated concept was conveyed through masterful story-telling, perfect voice acting and gorgeous soundtrack. It is not for the faint-hearted. You need to prepare yourself if you want to experience this story.The OST made me buy this game.",positive
OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom Edition,"It exceeded my expectations by far. It looks good, sure, and the concept is intriguing - but to truly see OPUS shine you have to simply play it, to experience the story yourself; because after all is said and done, this is a story first and foremost. Let me see if I can help you discern whether this is something you'd actually like to do. No spoilers.Quick overview:- it's more than a visual novel, there is also space travel with some resource management, and it's nice. It reminded me of Front Mission on SNES of all things- there are also sidescrolling exploration sections with some puzzle solving, but no action. There are timed segments, but there always is enough time if you don't dally.- the story's driving force is the fact that all characters are deeply, albeit consistently flawed. Take that for what you will- calling this a female protagonist game is a bit of a stretch. The game's protagonist is clearly Jun (the guy), as he's the PoV, although the character who has the most plot relevance/agency is indeed Eda- this is not at all a waifu game. Yes, there is romance, but it's of completely different flavour. So if you can't stand waifu stuff, rest assured.The setting is particularly interesting - it's this fine mixture of rough, space-station-core sci-fi in an universe filled by remains of literal gods. The world is ravaged by conflicts between corporations and the people; poverty and piracy are rampant, as is discrimination. Still, it's a very compelling world, and there are many opportunities to learn about it, and perhaps help out a little.And finally, there's the story. All I'm going to say is - it's well paced, it's emotional, there's some incredible foreshadowing which makes your heart burst at the end. And yes, there will be tears. Even though the game uses quasi-anime aesthetic, the amount of anime bullkacke is rather low, and what is there ends up being subverted anyway. If there's one criticism of the story I have - like I said before, the characters are deeply flawed, and that's what keeps the story going. If everyone went to therapy, there would've been no story. Ever read one of the old Greek tragedies, where the main character consistently digs their own grave? This is somewhat like that. Somewhat.Not much more to say. I enjoyed it quite a bit. If you like bittersweet stories, this is incredibly good as far as those go. If you don't, it's still a thrilling play. Hope this helped.",positive
OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom Edition,"A compelling narrative-driven game with plenty of exploration, resource management, and minigames mixed in, Echo of Starsong is as captivating as it is heart-rending. The story gets tear-jerkingly sad at various points, but prefaces itself as such, since you begin the game after the events of the ending, as the protagonist reflecting on his journey.That is not to say there aren't high points sprinkled in, with many small victories and character developments weaving together to make a beautiful narrative of strength through adversity and the power of faith. Which was revolutionary in a way, to me, that despite at its core being a love story, there is very little actual focus on any romance between the primary characters(partially on account of both Jun and Eda being sort of socially awkward and unable to properly express themselves, which gives a relatable quality to them that makes us root for them subconsciously), and instead it very much embodies the 'actions speak louder than words' mentality, that highlights their bond.You'll laugh, you'll cry, you may even die (yes, there are parts you can die, but get reverted to a checkpoint,one achievement even relies on it), but at the end of the day, I think it's a game everyone needs to play once, not only as a demonstration of professional-level writing and passable (but interesting) gameplay, but as a heartwarming insight into the human spirit.",positive
OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom Edition,"TL;DR: Fan of SIGONO enjoy himself once again, and recommand anyone to buy it. This is an experience worth having. For an even better adventure, playing the prequels is better but not required at all.I played ""OPUS: The Day We Found Earth"" on mobile back when I was in highschool (7 years ago), and that was a really good surprise. That was the first time I played such a good game on this device.When several years later I heard that ""OPUS: Rocket of Whispers"" was a thing, I bought it eyes closed. This game propelled SIGONO into that reserved place in my heart, along with few others.And finally, last year, I bought this game day 1. But for some reasons, I was not able to play it. Launching the  game was beyong my strength. I must also state that I was just coming out of depression. And this very day (yesterday tbh), after a year of rebuilding myself, this game pop up in my mind. I sat before my computer. Launched the game. Finished it. And I now, I feel emptiness. But the good one, you know? That kind of games is why video game is art to me.To the SIGONO's team, thank you.",positive

There is a lot I want to say about the story and the characters but I really donât want to spoil this visual novel. I also liked howJunhas actual character development in him and that I really liked, it breaks the trend of uninteresting main characters invisual novels.I do have two personal favorites of mine, one of them isEda, she is a witch whose kind is no longer useful after the war. She wants to travel to theThousand Peaksto reach a certain goal, I donât want to talk too much about it but I can understand her motives. She isnât afraid to miniplate people, if need be, as well but she has a soft side and prefers to be a pacifist. She is very happy to have met Jun and appreciates all he has done to help out.My next favorite character isBones, he is a side character but he was overall enjoyable. He may do things rough and works in methods that are illegal but he has a sense of honor. He will help people at times, which is very nice. I would also like to talk aboutRemia tad bit, she was also enjoyable even when she can be a bit of a jerk, however, I can see her reasoning in a way.I would love to talk more about these characters but I would spoil this VN, everyone is honesty a great character to talk about. They have a lot of depth to them that makes them fantastic characters.Although I would also like to point out that there are humanoidCapybarasin this VN and I should point out thatCapybarasare the greatest creatures to walk this Earth. The only issue is that these humanoidCapybarasare all jerks.AlthoughOpus: Echo of Star Songdoes have some gameplay to it, you will have to travel to different spots in the game to reach a certain destination. You will need gas to travel from place to place and if you run out, you will get a ship that will help you or you can buy it at shops. SinceJunis a cave explorer, he can go out and find stuff for the ship or stuff to sell at shops to buy supplies. You can even find information to go explore other caves as well.The ship can even be upgraded to have stuff like carrying more gas, extra armor, etc. There will be times when your ship will get attacked, so having the armor does help. There will also be times when you will be put into an event and given a choice on what to do. Some of these can be side quests or a run-in with someone, depending on what you do, you will be rewarded. However, some of these events do require some luck to be done. It all depends on how things go but there is a lot to experience.There are a few upgrades to help your travels.A Screenshot of OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom EditionBy:âSkyknighterI should mention that there is lots of lore in the game for you to find, it helps with the world building and the characters will even have some thoughts on certain locations. It not only adds to the world but to the character development as well.There is also a usage of sound in the VN as well,Edahas the power to use her singing voice to open other doors. Jun will then have to line up certain lines on the symbols on each door for it to open. I really liked how this was used, I do recommend playing the game with headphones to get the best experience possible while playing.Line up the lines with the door symbols to make the door open.A Screenshot of OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom EditionBy:âSkyknighterGraphics and PerformanceOpus Echo of Star Songis a very beautiful game, it has a very colorful art style that is very pleasing to look at with some very nice scenery.

OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom Edition,"Echo of Starsong is a game I bought because of the artstyle and with the question of ""will the ending devastate me emotionally"", and it worked out for meThis game certainly has a lot of flaws, gameplay boils down to two things, first, ""puzzles"" that are in reality more or less all the same, this however did not really impact my experience because of the ambiance and music, said puzzles last barely 10 seconds on average and, while yes it turns the game into a glorified walking simulator, gave me a chill experience, this however made me feel like tension was very poorly handled but only takes a very small amount of the game, the second gameplay aspect is the ship managing part, fuel, armor and some economy are involved, if you play at your own pace it shouldn't be a problem however they've made the achievements of this game to be borderline god awful to do and if you actually wanna do achievement hunting, there's meaningless challenges to do, for a game with little to no replayability, it's sad to see such gimmicky-relying achievementsSome ideas were thrown here and there but really nothing fantastic, I bought the game after the voices have been added and I cannot imagine the game without it, it greatly improves the experience and makes me even question why was it not in the game in the first placeIt all boils down to whether or not you like the story, it's flaws can be forgiven if it suits whoever plays the game in my opinion, a lot of people give a critique of the ending which I personally disagree with, the ending did not dissapoint me and I thought it was masterfully crafted, the fact that this game has a single ending (despite seemingly multiple ""choices"" in the story) can make it very understandable that it would be a dissapointment, the overwhelmingly positive reviews of the game make me think that most people should feel satisfied with it howeverMusic is also very cool, not a lot of insane tracks but the few that are worthy will stick at the back of my mind for a few yearsBut yeah tldr 10/10 would cry again",positive

OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom Edition,"I have completed the game, originally owned the GOG version and purchase the steam version to put out the review as steam is my main platform of choice. The hours of game play on steam are not indication of hours spent playing. I have about 9 hours of playtime which was enough time to complete the game.I don't usually write review but this is one of those exception. This game is a masterpiece and my personal game of the year for 2021. It is possibly one of the best visual novel game that I had played and it has left a huge impact on me emotionally. The pacing of the story is very well done as it is all wrap up nicely in 5 chapter. chapter 1-3  are most of the game while the final two are quite short and more or less the ending of the game.OPUS:EoS is a mixture of a visual novel, sidescroller and a bit of a table top experiences  that has a bit of rng that affect different situation presented in the game which work well enough to push the narrative. Though it can be a little bland at time.- Very Emotional and Beautifully Written Story ( You will most likely cry)- Likeable cast of Characters- Beautiful Soundtrack- Remind me Of ""Your Name"" and other Makoto Shinkai Film- Strong World Building and Rich Lore- Beautiful Artwork and Visual- Not Very Long ( 8-12 hours of playtime)- Don't need to play any previous entry as their each a standalone game set in the same universeI am never recovering from that ending and I am very much excited to see what the dev team has in store for future entry in the OPUS series.",positive
OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom Edition,"This is not so much a game as it is a story. A wonderful, heart moving, and beautifully orchestrated story. OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom Edition has some gameplay elements that could generously be called space ship resource management and exploration, but everything is in service to the story and music. Itâs a hair away from a glorified visual novel. I loved it, though. It really got into my head; the beautiful music, art style and storytelling made you feel 100% invested into what was happening.The music by itself flowed in a way that both relaxes and pulls gently at emotions. Iâm not a music guy and I donât know who wrote it, but this is the type of music to mellow yourself out with after a long day. Iâm glad I bought the edition that came with the soundtracks. The game experience wouldnât be half of what it is without it.The story isâ¦well, itâs better if you go in blind, but, very roughly itâs about discovery, both within and without. The characters arenât epic fantasy heroes, they are emotionally complex people that live during a post war torn space economy while trying to find their place within it. The lore is vague, and not spoon fed to you, the more you explore the more you understand the way that region of space molded into what it looks like. The religion, the governments, the factions, and the technology; all of it is more deeply connected than it first appears.I encourage a person who just wants a more emotion based experience over a complex skilled based one to play this, or at the very least, buy the soundtrack.As an aside, performance wise, I played this game on Steam Deck from beginning to end and it ran smoothly. As a far warning, for those who are interested, there is no English dubbing, only subtitles. For audio there is, at this time, only Japanese or Chinese available.",positive

OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom Edition,"Product received for freeEcho of Starsong states in its description that it is a narrative puzzle adventure game and it really is. What I mean by that is that it is not a false advertisement but a pure one as it says in its description. Itâs rare to see something so fitting to those tags these days as many lack in some way to fulfill the tag purpose. It is indeed a narrative adventure and not just a virtual novel with a lot of lore and text but at the same time you get puzzles and tasks and even some management/market elements (upgrade your ship, buy-sell, exchange, etc).You set out to help your clan find lumen â a rare material and also a religious âsignâ â from various planets and asteroids. You try to mine it and extract it to make your clan great again. But you are not alone in this adventure as you have friends and acquaintances to help you â or be obstacles to you- on your adventures. Above all, to find the lumen sources you need a starsong and for this you have Edaâs (a witch â and the only race that can sing the starsong) help and of course other less mystical techniques to help you along. The technology presented is a variation of steampunk and it is amazingly designed!Apart from beautiful designs and colors, the game has a perfectly fitting music and itâs also quite unique and interesting. Great soundtrack. In my gameplay so far I encountered no bugs at all and everything is carefully and slowly explained. Youâll have no question as to what to do or how to do it. But at the same time it doesnât feel like a tutorial but only as part of the game. The story behind it is also fantastic and you wonât want to stop at all. Very heart warming and hearth breaking at the same timeâ¦ Simply written yet extremely effectiveâ¦ You wonât lose interest for 1 second. You get nice breaks of exploration and depending on your choices you have more less things to do in game (you can progress the story faster by doing less exploration â donât do itâ¦ itâs worth it). The characters are well written and their actions fit their presentation in the game and are quite likeable even when their actions are âsillyâ.I highly recommend this one as I find it exceptional in every aspect. I would recommend this one at full price, itâs totally worth it! Itâs a rare example of how great a narrative puzzle adventure can be, how good it reads and how awesome it sounds. Add to this the many hours of playtime and you get a full-on mind blowing adventure in your hands. I donât regret a single second in this game and Iâm going back for more!For more reviews, follow my curatorhttps://store.steampowered.com/curator/44864435-Mewesome-Reviews/",positive
OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom Edition,"I'll be honest, I really would like there to be an option to leave comments/reviews on a game without having to give thumbs up or down, gimme a neutral rating. Full transparency here: I'm more than certain the game is fine if not even good if you go in expecting the right thing. Treat it as a visual novel, a story to watch rather than a game to play. I went in with the mayhaps misplaced expectation that I could make decisions to influence the plot. But, honestly, that doesn't even matter that much. What does matter, however, is the fact that the first choice the game gives you is horrible.It tells you to choose, only to immediately make you die and restart if you happen to make the clearly more sensible choice: Do you haphazardly run into an armed squad of criminals to try and save a girl held at gunpoint? Or do you wait it out and see what happens? CLEARLY JUST RUN IN, WHAT ELSE CAN YOU DO!? And yes, waiting it out leads to you dying because the criminals just happen to notice you behind your cover and shoot you, but if you â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ run at them like a maniac they won't, of course.Please don't waste my time with choices that just lead to a boring game over only to have me redo the section and pick the other option. Especially if the ""game over"" choice, judged by common sense, should without even an ounce of doubt be the best course of action. If the story is linear and the characters are meant to do a certain thing in a given situation, have them do it. ... Anyways, I might get back to this once I find the patience to push through these fake choices. The World seems decently interesting, and while I don't find the art amazing, it's also not appalling, though the character portraits really aren't that great. (and yes, I have enjoyed Visual Novels before). Hope you have fun with it if you do happen to buy it.",negative
OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom Edition,"Is a beautifully crafted emotional journey that romanticizes the stars. If youâre a fan of sci-fi stories about exploration, loss, and a love that transcends time and space, this game will resonate deeply with you.That said, the plot feels like it was written with the approval of the Sigono CEOâs mom ð The female leadâs entire arc revolves around finding her master, with whom she shares a daughter-mother relationship. It leans heavily into the archetype of the strict, tough-love âAsian mom,â with the daughter ready to sacrifice her entire life for the sake of her âfamilyâ ð¥²Easy to play and run on Steam Deck.",positive
OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom Edition,"I bought this game due to its overwhemingly positive reviews, but unfortunately it was rather underwhelming.There are some positive aspects of the game:- I like the graphics and the music, the game is really quite beautiful.- The story seems to be good enough, but I cannot really tell, because (at least I think) in my 8 hours of playing I did not progress very far.Which brings me to the negative point:- The gameplay is not very interesting, but quite time consuming without being fun.- The idea of ""aligning"" something based on sounds doesn't feel original -- this is maybe the 3rd or 4th game I played this year with almost the same mechanics.- The ""puzzles"" of the game feel in no way rewarding because the are absolutely no challenge. Honestly, I cannot imagine someone who is not able to solve them.So all in all, if you have way too much time and don't want your game to be too hard (or at least a tiny little bit hard), then this might be a game for you.",negative
OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom Edition,"I don't usually leave negative reviews, but at the time of writing this, this game has an overwhelmingly positive rating and that might affect the decision of potential buyers in purchasing it.Let's start with the good. The art style is sleek, with occasional gorgeous cosmic backgrounds that make you pause to take an screenshot or to admire the view. The lore of ancient civilisations and the histories found across the galaxy are quite engaging. The music is pleasant. The gameplay isn't anything revolutionary, but it keeps things flowing and in a visual novel, what carries most of the weight is the story.Now. The story should be taken as a cautionary tale of how not to live your lives. Here we have three characters with extreme fear of rejection having unhealthy relationships. These fears and the refusal to grow and move on often lead to catastrophic decisions and the death of others. It wouldn't be a problem if this was simply a tragic tale offering the perspective of people dealing with many anxieties, but the game goes to great lengths to portray this as beautiful, honourable even.There are also some side plots and conspiracies which are brought up halfway in the game that are never later addressed, but the harmful dynamic of the three main characters are my reason for giving this a thumbs down.",negative
OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom Edition,"OPUS: Echo of Starsong stands almost entirely on the quality of its story and writing, The graphics and sound are good enough to support the story, but the game play is mobile game casual - wandering around a map triggering mini-events with resolution by a throw of the dice, plus a relatively small number of 3rd person cave exploration missions that include some light puzzle solving mixed with plot advancing character conversations.Ultimately, whether you enjoy OPUS or not comes down to whether you find the story compelling, and whether you find the story compelling will largely depend on how you feel about anime-style story tropes. It's at least the sort of anime story that tries to take the world and characters seriously and doesn't engage in wild and crazy anime humor (which I have a low tolerance for), but, for me, it still missed the mark. There's anime out there that I greatly enjoy watching, with interesting characters and well thought out worlds and plot points, but this doesn't rise to that level. I could take or leave the world design (mystic space opera), but I just couldn't engage with the private angsts and interpersonal drama of the crew, which just seemed overwrought and simplistic.I don't want to give the impression that I hated the game - I played it through to completion, and spent the time to explore more than the bare minimum locations - but it's a game that I finished with a shrug despite the copious attempts to pull my heart strings and just uninstalled. If you have a warm spot in your heart for anime story telling and art and most of the anime you've watched, then you may well get more mileage out of it than I did. 5/10 - maybe pick it up on a sale or if you love all things anime.",negative
OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom Edition,"Not a terrible game, but not a good one either.The story here is front and center, and the supporting gameplay is very shallow. After the extensive start and opening up to flying around ""freely"", there is a little bit of resource management, but really there is always a very limited set of options. Materials for ship upgrades come in order as you need them. Having bad luck with a random encounter leaves you with a tale of failure you can sell for a little bit of money.Exploring is equally basic: walk around on the one path, find a star song, open valves. You have always all your star songs for selection, but only ever need the current one you've got.Well, how is the story then? Just passable. The world building for the setting isn't great. Lumen is important, it's fuel, it's armor, it's in everything. There is nothing you come across that doesn't contain the stuff. Somehow, you can only locate it by listening/singing to it, and it's strewn about ancient asteroids with still functioning technology. Nothing of this makes much sense to me.The characters are at least well portrait, I think. They have their own issues and personalities, even if there is little growth there.The 2D art is good, while the rest of the consists of mainly characters talking, item and place descriptions with brief interludes of clicking on prompts. I can't but think this really should have been one linear anime film instead of a game.",negative
OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom Edition,"Okay, so first of all: this is a VISUAL NOVEL/WALKING SIMULATOR.I'm not sure why this game isn't advertised as such and why these tags aren't showed, because if you play it a few, it become pretty obvious.And as such, it's probably a good one, but I'm not a big fan of the genre. There are some things that brings some interactivity, like some ""puzzles"" (which are so easy that it must be there just to give you some interactivity), ""decision makings"" (where you not really making any decision, just choose how you react to a given situation), and random events with RNG BS, but ultimately, it is what it is: a visual novel/walking sim.Unfortunatelly for me, the visuals (which reminds me of Another World), the music, the singing, the whole atmosphere of the game is spot-on, and I was mesmerized and was already past the 2 hours mark when I realized, that this game is just missing the ""game"" part.Another negative thing is that you can't save manually, or access the menu. Basically, you can't just simply exit this game, but you have to use ALT+F4. And autosave means that sometimes you have to wait for like half an hour for the current part to end, because the game just won't save your game very often.Oh, and one more thing: the protagonist is a little cry baby, which I hate. I was honestly rooting for the bad guys every time he (I) got into some kind of trouble.Button line: if you're into visual novels/walking sims, give it a try, you'll probably love this game, otherwise, just avoid it (or watch it on YT).",negative
OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom Edition,"Well this game is pretty good, I mean I would probably call it game of the yearâ¦although I think that goes more to the just poor showing in 2021 for good games.  I mean there is a reason this game has gotten extremely positive reviews.  The story is fantastic, easily one of the best scifi stories out there that easily rivals a lot of scifi novels.  The soundtrack is wonderful and fits the game perfectly.  The world looks beautiful.  The world feels really lived in.  Even the characters you meet along the way are all interesting people instead of just random cyphers.My problem with the game is that, this game should have decisions that matter and it simply doesnât.  The bulk of the game is a visual novel, although it does have light puzzle elements, and light space ship management, and some very linear exploration, but mainly the gameplay is you going to a place and just talking to people.  This is perfectly fine for me, I love those type of games.  However, I want those types of games to have impactful decisions.In Opus you are constantly making decisions on who to trade with, who to talk to, who you should rescue/helpâ¦but it never amounts to anything.  Each decision might mean you get slightly more resources for the spaceship management part of the gameâ¦but it doesnât ever change the games story or your relationship with any of the characters in this universe.  Itâs a big misstep.  I get that the developers clearly had a vision for the story they wanted to tellâ¦but I mean you could easily do that and then have decisions that drastically effect side charactersThe main characters in the game are really just Jun, Eda, and Remi.  So even if the Developers wanted the story for those characters to be locked in, I donât understand why you can have other characters that you could meet throughout the game and cause different events to happen.  There are plenty of side characters like Bonesâ¦but no matter how you act with these people, it never changes anyway.  Itâs very frustrating because if this game had far more consequential decisions I would literally be calling this game a masterpiece.Instead itâs just a very good scifi game and the world it creates is one I wish this developers tells more stories in.  But to be clear, I want still smaller stories.  The best thing about this game is that it really is just about Jun, Eda, and Remi and their life together and how they deal with trauma.  The game has big crazy things going on in the background like an interstellar war, dangerous old gods, and crazy space politics that all feel at home in a Stellaris campaignâ¦but the games has this all playing out in the background and makes clear your characters really donât care at all and the game makes clear it has no interest in making your characters apart of all these wild stories going on.  I love it, Iâm just exhausted that every scifi story is you trying to save the world.I think everyone should at least play this game, I will say the lack of voice acting and choices make this a hard sell for more than $15 though.  I think my dream game would kind of be a combination between this game and Haven where the relationship is much more mature and explicit, but with the spaceship management, visual novel aspects, space exploration, and with the world/setting that is present in this gameâ¦instead of the terrible planet exploration of Haven which I found unbearable.  #Worth $15",positive

OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom Edition,"The story of Opus is surprisingly not that complex or deep; it draws some allegorical connection to the fictional mythology in-game, but beyond that it's a story of struggle - three different people and their different struggles. Despite the lack of depth/complexity, the story still managed to draw some tears from me in its ending. Sometimes the simplest stories can be beautiful. What really saddens me is that this game had the potential to be something much more grandiose and magnanimous, but it felt like it didn't have enough confidence to keep the wheels rolling when it gained speed, so as soon as it reached a relatively high velocity they hit you with the climax. A solid 7.5/10, definitely would recommend for people that enjoy tear-jerkers.",positive

OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom Edition,"Product received for freeTarget Audience:Those Who Like Good Grounded StoriesSummary:Opus Echo of Starsong is one of those games that it's clear that the writers understand how to not only handle character building and plot structure, but also understands that the story is the main draw of the game. Sure, the simulation/exploration aspects do enough to make you feel like you are having an impact and yet doesn't do a whole lot to really stand out in the big picture. But it doesn't need to: with a haunting yet soothing sound design and beautiful presentation backing it up, you follow an emotional journey that knows how to pull on your heartstrings, but also knows that it has to earn those climatic moments.The plot points are grounded in reality yet establish a fantastic lore that makes you want to see more. Characters earn their arcs by having small events that establish their personality, but convert to a different one over time. Set Pieces help keep you interested while not feeling too ridiculous. The themes are familiar yet aren't boring at the same time. And emotionally, it pulls on heartstrings and will make you feel what it wants you to feel every single time.I'm glad that the game is getting major attention on Steam: because it deserves it.

OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom Edition,"Narrative space adventure game, visual novel set in space, side scrolling adventure, sound puzzle game.This game has it all. I am 7 hours into it so far and I am really enjoying it,The graphics are really nice to look at and the game is played at a slower pace, puzzles are easy and for any exploration there seems to be only one path to go.  There is plenty of world building and lore to readSome decision making is involved as the game progresses but so far it has only meant if you get items to repair your ship or not mostly. The sound puzzles are nice and had me remembering an old adventure game called Loom.Will review again when I have progressed further into the story.",positive
OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom Edition,"Don't judge this game by the gameplay (I know, the puzzles are repetitive yada yada yada), but take a look at the art, soundtrack, and most importantly the story. I'm not going to say a lot about the story (since it will be a spoiler), but the characters are pretty relatable and the way the story was told is amazing. This game is somewhat of a guilty pleasure and makes you feel like ""ah f*ck I want to see what's the next chapter is like but the puzzles are a pain in the ass."" sort of feeling. In the end of the day, (if you are me) you ended up finishing this game in 10 hours or so and sobbing in the end of the game. From the art and character design aspect, it is stunning. The environment of each caves look very good and the way they made the whole universe feels so big makes you feel like you're a small fish in a wide ocean. The character design is nice too. And oh boy don't get me started on the soundtrack. The vocals and instrumentals are amazing, get a good headphones to play this game or at least a decent speaker. I don't really know what to say anymore but to end this review, I'd say this game deserves 9/10. Play it and you'll see why. To the devs, thank you for this amazing game and I'll be waiting for your next releases.",positive
OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom Edition,"I do not really understand all the positive reviews for this game.To me, it was boring most of the time. I know that this is a visual novel and therefore rather focses on telling a story than on the gameplay. But it felt like the actual story was just 1/4 of the whole game. The rest was filler.Gameplay:A big portion of the game consists of travelling with your spaceship through space. You have a map of the universe and can travel to near planets or space stations. Whenever you travel to a specific spot, it gives you a short text summary about it. It offers you a few places that you can visit by clicking another text box. Then you get more info about the given place on the planet / station. Sometimes, you encounter someone who asks you for something. Then you get to choose between multiple options how to react - some options require luck to be successful. This means that you roll a dice and have to get at least a given value for the option to succeed.Neither the choice of your action nor the success/failure of your action felt like having a big impact. It usually just determines which item you get or which resources you lose. So these choices felt pointless.When travelling between planets, you sometimes encounter enemies that try to attack you. Again, you get to choose how to react and sometimes have to roll the dice. If you succeed, nothing happens - else your ship loses some armor. If your ship reaches 0 armor, you are dead and you start at the last checkpoint. Now you can just face the same encounter again and hope for a better dice role. So managing the armor of the ship does not feel important because you do not get a real penalty or consequences if you fail.You can also collect items, sell them and upgrade your ship. I always had plenty of money and fully upgraded my ship at 4/5th of the game. I never had to make a difficult decision what to upgrade because I could afford anything.Sometimes, you explore planets and run around from left to right. You have to unblock doors by playing a recorded song in front of them. That's almost all you do. Sometimes, there a some other mini games / puzzles which all felt boring. None of them was challenging.Story:I liked the story. However, I found it difficult to follow the reasoning of the characters sometimes. This made me be less involved in the story.You get tons of items that tell you about the universe and all the gods. I never fully got how the universe works and which gods exist. I could never get a feeling for the universe because there were just too many terms and names used in all the items descriptions.The story how you meet your crew and try to find beloved people that are somewhere out there, is an emotional one that works for me.It was definitely not worth my time because it took me 11 hours to finish and I only enjoyed the main story which could have been compressed into a 4 hour game. I would have preferred this game to either be way shorter of have more demanding gameplay.",negative
OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom Edition,"Bought this game on a whim because I'm a sucker for sad stories. I sat through it in a single night following the journey of the Red Chamber crew (I played it offline so idk why steam didn't record my playtime that night). For some reason, someone decided to cut onions in front of me while I was watching the ending so I was crying in front of my computer screen at 7 in the morning. Never felt like this towards a piece of fiction in a long time. I wish I can forget the entire game so I can experience the ending again. The only disappointing thing about this game is there's not much discussion about it online.",positive
OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom Edition,"I'm going to give this game a 9/10:I really enjoyed the characters and the world building.The characters are written very well (for the most part, I will get into it later). Their character development throughout this game is one of, if not the best games I have played. I'm not going to quote examples, as this game is best played through blind.The world building on the other hand was one of the most fantastic I have seen, even for a visual novel. Sigono has outdid themselves on this aspectNow the story; the story is not optimistic and bombastic, rather it is a melancholic episode through a vast space with 3 characters trying to fulfill their goals (what goals they want to fulfill is something you want to explore yourself). The perfect world building, along with the characters and their development makes the story fantastic. There are many emotional moments in the story, which made me want to play the next chapter so eagerly. It is one of the games where the story has kept me invested for so long because the world and characters felt so real and alive.However, I have a one gripe for this game. When I said the character development was good for the most part, I meant it.Towards the end, I felt that the characters Eda and Jun were underwritten, especially compared to the rest of the story. I will not go into details, but to put it simply, I wished Sigono developed Eda and Jun's relationship between each other  further than it has, as I felt that the ending felt incomplete and unjustified because of the amount of unseen character to character development that has happened but was not shown in the story. It made the story fall flat at the end and made the ending feel too abrupt for my taste.That being said, that is the only gripe I had with this game, as the story is fantastic otherwise, and if you do not mind a slightly abrupt ending to a game, then get this game, its worth the money, but do be aware like other Sigono games, there is not many gameplay elements, this title in particular has resource management, but its all not that important.P.S. The other games are not needed to play OPUS: Echo of Starsong, but I will personally recommend getting Rocket of Whispers as I didn't really enjoy The day we found Earth.",positive

OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom Edition,"Normally I donÂ´t do reviews but this one is a necessity.If I would be asked what game is my favourite of all time, than I would without a doubt say the name of this perfect work of art... It has such a special place in my heart and deserves so much more love and attention.If I needed to describe this game I would say a book was made into a living breathing world you can experience. But you still have to love reading if you want to enjoy the game, because every item or so called ""memory"" has such a well written description that its just fun, learning more about this dystopian future. I know this kind of gameplay is not for everybody and this is completely fine!One memory in particular stands out over any other for me, thewispy witchÂ´s starsong, because it was the reason I fell in love with this visual novel. After seeing, hearing and reading the description of the item I immediately closed the game on my game pass and made the biggest leap of faith in my gaming life. I bought not only the game but every other game in the whole opus franchise in one bundle and after that waited half a year for the physical collectors edition, just to play the first and second title by sigono and see the growth of their quality. And not once did their storys and ideas disappoint. But still Echo of Starsong stood out with its amazing storytelling throughout and just so many greatly executed twists around every corner.If you love a good book and a romance story that you wont forget, with a soundtrack that will shape every daydream of yours than this is your game.Thank you Sigono for creating something that beautiful <3!",positive
OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom Edition,"A little late to the party, but I personally think the game was well worth the price.The mixture of visual novel, sidescroller, and space-esque resource management (fuel, armor, supplies) worked out pretty well in my opinion and helped to convey the story while having decent gameplay mechanics to supplement it. The story itself is quite memorable and impactful to me. I liked the artstyle and the use of the lowpoly aesthetic worked well for the gameplay.The various implications from the mythology and documents that you recover tell a story that isn't always obvious and builds a world that makes sense. There were many things that I didn't even notice until someone else mentioned this or that document. Many different points in the story also allow for an open interpretation. Reading into some of the discussions surprised me with how different some of the interpretations were.The music was very good. Might not be for everyone, but I'd buy the OST if I weren't trying to save money right now.Regarding the end:While very depressing, if you look deeper into it, I think that you might be able say that the end is actually a good one? Sure, there are alternatives to make the ending happier, but the way it did end wasn't completely hopeless.My interpretation is thatEda and Jun are reincarnations of Helius and Terra respectively, and that although their reunion is not quite in their current lives, its after through the lumen. (This is partially based off some of the decipherments in the Guides section in addition to my initial interpretation of the story)But who knows, I could be completely wrong.Regardless, it's going to take me a while to recover from that ending though.I don't normally write real reviews, but this is a game that I thoroughly enjoyed and think deserves its high praise and ratings. 9.5/10",positive
OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom Edition,"This is my first OPUS game I think.If you like heart touching sad stories this is for you.I do not like stories that just gets super depressing at the end.

If you're here for that you probably will not be dissapointed.",negative
OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom Edition,"More than a year after playing this game, I still think very highly of it.The story is a charming mesh of space adventure, mythology, spirituality, anti-war-isms, and romanticism. It does a fantastic job unravelling its characters as it progresses, exploring their psyches, emotions, and interpersonal conflicts. When combined with the music, this gives the game a rich atmosphere - somewhat reminiscent of Makoto Shinkai's works, if you're familiar with his movies.The game also has good Chinese voice acting, and runs well on Steam Deck.Gameplay-wise, the game is basically a resource management walking/exploration simulator with the occasional puzzles. The resource management is mechanically straightforward, and mostly serves to add some realism to zooming around the solar system and avoiding space pirates (and cops). I wasn't really a fan of the puzzles, as controls felt kind of unintuitive and required a lot more trial and error to solve than I would have liked (perhaps a skill issue on my part?), but they didn't hinder my overall enjoyment.I honestly did not expect much going into this game, but I'm really happy I played this. Very much worth trying out if you're into emotional narratives.",positive
OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom Edition,"You are probably looking at this because you like a narrative-focused experience with just enough gameplay to keep you involved. If so, this would fit the bill. The gameplay is a not too challenging resource management game while you hop across destinations to uncover more story. This is mostly OK, but having optional story elements locked behind what is pure RNG can be frustrating. Could have used a reduction in Time-To-Fun (ie shorten the cutscenes from game launch to loading and resuming the game) since I kind of had to restart the game whenever I failed an important roll.Now the main point - how is the story? Yes, it's crafted to be a tearjerker. To be frank, it's not To The Moon or Omori level of story. A better comparison would be one of the shorter Key visual novels for its tropeyness and predictable storyline. Its biggest shortcoming is that it does not spend enough time flourishing the relationship between the two main characters. Throughout the story both of them are tunnel-visioned on their tasks instead of enjoying each other's company for the journey, such that their whole relationship centered on just a single major scene, and thus the final climax does not reach its fullest potential. On the tearjerker scale I rate this 2/10 tissues.Decent, but not a must-buy. Nice to snag on a sale and chill with over a weekend.",positive

It was amazing seeing how much they've improved and elevated their skills through the development of this game.The whole OPUS series has that theme of pursuing the near impossible in order to find a close and personal connection in worlds that can get very lonely, and to me that's super powerful and moves me every time.Can't wait to see more from Sigono Inc. <3",positive
OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom Edition,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I picked up this game. But I was blown away. I don't want to give too many details, but this game is really something special. I almost never buy soundtracks for games, but I made an exception for this one. Well polished, and gave me an experience that only VA-11 HALL-A can rival in terms of quality (note: they are very different games, but the feeling of ""experiencing"" this game felt similar to how deeply invested I was).",positive
OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom Edition,"Tears were shed.More an interactive story than a game, but what a RIDE. If you're a lore and mythos buff, there is so much symbolism and are so many little clues all throughout the game to find and puzzle over, and even if you're not or don't find them the story is amazing. The music is amazing. This whole game is amazing. 10/10 Recommend to everyone.",positive

OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom Edition,"I gave OPUS an honest try after my good friend recommended it to me. I usually love video games with an actual story, and seeing one made by Chinese developers was exciting. The music is indeed beautiful and the characters are delightfully multifaceted. However, OPUS has serious problems with its start-and-stop pacing, occasionally incoherent writing (it gets bad, to a mind-boggling degree), and mechanical tedium. I'm somewhat surprised by how well it's been received on Steam, but it's not for me.",negative
OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom Edition,"Don't be fooled by the relatively simple gameplay. This game exists to tell an incredibly gripping and emotional story, and that's all that matters.",positive
OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom Edition,Just complete this game in one sitting even thought i have 3 deadlinesStill worth it,positive
OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom Edition,"It's the best indie game that I ever played in my life. It's even better than ""Journey"" from TGC. I give it 99/100.If you are still consider to play it, just buy it and play. 100% satisfied.",positive
OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom Edition,"This game was so close to go from ""just ok"" to being a masterpieceGood:+ Lovable cast of characters with good developments+ Aesthetically pleasing visuals+ Inclusion of the mini-games keeps the story interesting+ High Immersion (really feels like you are in space and going between between places)Bad:- Absolutely hated the ending (the ending seems forced, and the player honestly is powerless to stop it. I understand that this is a sad story, but at least gives us an alternative ending or true ending with some crazy requirements that we can work toward)- Narration (story is told as ""this is what happened"", not a big fan of getting 90% of the story spoiled in the beginning)Rating:3/5 Dial soap bars",positive
OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom Edition,"All i can say this game is beautiful and sad. The story is really good and engaging. You might cry a lot in the game.The artstyle is beautiful, soundtrack is beautiful. Some of the character is good, and some is kind of annoying. The addition of voice acting give more emotion to the story, rather than just text.This game broke my heart in the few last minute. And it deserve to be an amazing game.But, it might a bit downfall, cause there is no multiple save slot. But there is chapter select once you finish the game, but i'm not sure how this gonna affect the achievements especially if its related to moral choice and collecting items.Overall i really enjoying it, and i wish we could see more relationship between jun and eda.",positive
OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom Edition,"Worldbuilding, lore and music are pretty dope, so if you're just interested in that I'd think it's worth a shot. However, other reviewers gave me the impression that the story was the main draw, and I've never felt so betrayed. I can't believe I'm saying this because I'm usually the most oblivious person when it comes to predicting where a story is going but this one... it went exactly how I thought it would go every step along the way. It doesn't help that the story is told from the perspective of the MC as an old man, and you can pretty quickly anticipate what lead him to that point in the story, which unfortunately made me not emotionally invested at all.",negative
OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom Edition,"I bought this game because it looked interesting and went in not knowing what to expect. After experiencing the journey from OPUS: Echo of Starsong I simply cannot recommend this game enough.The carefully crafted world, the gripping and melancholic story, the interesting and charming characters, the beautiful art style and amazing music make this game a genuine masterpiece to play through.",positive
OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom Edition,"Look, you don't need to cry at the end to enjoy this game, I was just smiling and that's fine.It's good when the bad reviews have valid points to make, primarily that you're not really buying a game per se, but a VN.As long as you're aware that that's what this is, then I'd say your expectations are already lowered in terms of gameplay.When you're not reading or solving little audio puzzles, you're exploring the galaxy, juggling resources and money for you ship.It's not a complex gameplay loop and the game's set such that it's pretty hard to fail.What you can fail however are the skill checks which is the other neg point I think everyone can agree on.They're annoying because there's not way to reroll/redo the event without quitting and reloading the game.The rewards for passing them however include collectible items for the journal which means that you'll need to do some old school save scumming to fill everything out.I say old school because there's no manual saving, it's all autosave.(it's frequent but still annoying that you can't manually save)It's not mandatory to fill everything out the journal, but the game encourages you to find as many of the pieces as you can, so it's just bad game design.(after you finish the game there's a chapter select which makes things marginally easier)It also just feels bad because every location and item has flavor text for world building and it's quite impressive.Anyways, it was a great experience overall despite it's flaws and I'm glad I bought it on sale.The standard price seems pretty fair to me so buy it whenever you like and play when you're in the right mind to just read.PS. I actually don't recommend 100% the achievements or the journal, they feel like busy work with diminishing returns. I say this as someone with about 70-80% of the journal filled with 1 run.",positive
OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom Edition,"Now I haven't played a lot of visual novels to really make apt comparisons, but OPUS: Echo of Starsong is a sublime and masterfully crafted narrative experience that stands out to me because it has somehow managed to perfectly tell a character-driven story, within a lore-rich, solar system that you actually traverse with a galaxy map. On top of this they nail the audio design, the visuals , the UI/UX, as well as the voice acting. For a visual novel this is as good as it gets in my opinion.--Story Thoughts--The story is presented to you as a giant flashback which you play out. I initially thought this would be a cheap narrative device, but I was wrong. The story built-up beautifully to the ending and I have nothing negative to say regarding its conclusion. The three main characters are pretty well written, although there were some tropey lines here and there as well as some 'medium' thick plot armour. (But this is coming from a guy who has watched an ungodly amount of anime, so honestly for most people I don't think it's going to be an issue). Something that surpassed my expectations, was how deep and well thought-out the galaxy/setting was. I was probably more invested, in the galaxy's mythology, symbolism, history, and political factions, than I was to the characters actually. The outstanding world-building, combined with a galaxy map, was reminiscent of Mass Effect for me.--""Gameplay"" Thoughts--The core 'gameplay' consists of you travelling from location to location around the galaxy in a mostly linear story pathway while you manage ship resources such as fuel or armour. Occasional events will require player choice, leading to different outcomes. Outcomes are determined by a dice roll and have no major impact to the story. This however does mean, that you most likely will not be able to unveil all collectables in one playthrough (meaning 100%-ing this game is difficult). At major story points, you may enter into a 2.5D interactive segment, which really is there to show you plot events in a game-like fashion rather than be a 'puzzle'. I wanted to make that clear as some reviews mentioned their disappointment in the 'puzzles'. Let's be real, those aren't puzzles. Think of them as...interactive elements. This is a visual novel first and foremost.-- Note: I do think this would make a great anime adaptation. I don't think it's going to happen though.",positive
OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom Edition,"It's a fine story but I don't feel it benefited from the gameplay that it had. a couple of choices that could be made, some very simple puzzles, minor resource management and dice rolls that you can get buffs for... genuinely feel that would've been a better experience as a pure visual novel",negative

OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom Edition,"Never reviewed a game before, but this one was worth the review.10/10. Flawless. Could not recommend this game more for those who love visual novels and those who love an immersive story. The music/sound could not be better. Thanks for making this game and for making it easily accessible to a wide range of audiences.",positive
OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom Edition,"Very solid story:The story is not only about the romance, but also showing the meaning of life. The story is built in a very solid way with a lot of positive and negative moments. Finishing the full story will take about 10-15 hours.The gameplay is dynamic:You can follow the main story, but you will notice you will need money and upgrades to be better prepared to do the next mission. What do you do? You'll grind. As you grind you will explore more of the galaxy and know more about the lore of the galaxy. Besides that, you really notice improvement as you grind. So in conclusion: it's obvious you have to do the main story, but a little grind is needed to continue.Ending:The ending can be seen as positive or negative depending if you're optimistic or pessimistic. But one thing is sure it will make you realize the meaning of life, which is the heart of this story.Bugs:I haven't encounterd any bugs in the whole story. So it's a very solid game!In conclusion:A very solid game with a nice story and gameplay with a very touching ending. I would say this is a perfect game but nothing is perfect. So a 9/10 for me!",positive
OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom Edition,"I decided this will be my one and only Steam review ever, as a testament to how much this game and everything about it, has resonated with me.Give this game a chance to reach out to your heart as well. Please give me a moment to tell you why you should.I've gone so far as to clear all my save data and reset my Steam Achievements for this game in the hopes that in the future, when the time is right, I might experience the game anew. It pains me to no end that I cannot play this game for the first time ever again, and I write this partially to cope with that fact.The team at Sigono truly put a boundless amount of care into the creation of this game and it shows in every aspect. The story is heartfelt, personal and intimate. It had me absorbed in emotions over and over again, as I followed along eagerly at every moment. The setting was so meticulously crafted, written to be full of lore, and feel so full of life, that it makes you wish that you could unravel the mysteries and mythos of that universe in your own life, and travel the very same stars yourself. The characters were so thoughtfully and carefully written. I found myself, while knowing full-well that they are fictional entities, enraptured by emotions of worry, hope, sadness and joy as I played through and experienced their journey. I cared about their history, well-being, motivations, dreams and thoughts, both good and bad, just as I would any real person. Never before in any piece of media, be it books or movies, have I found myself so absorbed. I'm sure if you're in the right place to open your mind and heart to the world and their story, you will be too.The art and its direction are full of meaning, both somber and illustrious. It perfectly captures the feeling of a vibrant cosmos so full of history, both ethereal and advanced. It managed to illustrate exactly what the cast might appear as, if you only knew of their personality and voice. I felt innate, visible sadness when they frowned or cried, and I showed signs of great happiness on my face as I watched them smile. I'm fairly straight faced most of the time, so I found myself surprised by the fact. I took the time to admire every piece of art as if every frame were a perfect photograph.And of course, the music was beautiful in ways I could never describe properly with words. I wish I could, if only to convince you further of its majesty. Triodust and Chia-Wei Hsu did an incredible job of creating an unforgettable soundtrack. Simply put, every track, no matter how short or long, was remarkably evocative from the very beginning to the very end. I've never found myself so enchanted by a game and I firmly believe much of it is thanks to the songs that were tied to the cast and their story.Give OPUS: Echo of Starsong a try. It is truly something special.If any of you are still reading this, thank you. It really means a lot to me, a man who simply wishes for more people to experience this beautiful title. I wish there was more! Not for lack of anything at all. But simply because the feeling of wishing to see more of this world and the character's lives lingers with me still. I soon plan on buying the physical collector's edition so that I can have some real-life merch of this once-in-a-lifetime experience. If only there were more to get! I'm very thankful to everyone involved in the development of the game, and wanted to say if any of them happen to read this that they have done such a wonderful job. You've truly made a fan of me, and if there was any way I could help support or spread the word further like I hope to do with this review, I would do so in a heartbeat. What a heartfelt story, what a lovely cast, what a captivating soundtrack, what an experience. If I had any one wish at this moment, it is that I could forget the whole thing so I could experience it all over again.I could never express it enough:I love this game. And I think you will too.",positive

OPUS: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom Edition,"Aesthetic. Intriguing. Meaningful.OUT OF EXPECTATION (10/10)Great pleasure to witness the growth of SIGONO, from âThe Day We Found Earthâ to this work. If the previous work âRocket Of Whispersâ is a pilot project of blending sci-fiction with supernatural power, âEcho Of Starsongâ makes a more ambitious attempt to fully depict a pluralistic interstellar territory, where modern space stations coexist with ancient ruins, and navigation system of spacecraft relies on both post-modern techs and witchâs song. Personally, âEcho Of Starsongâ succeeds in this challenging task, and makes me looking forward to reading more stories taking place in this universe.Meanwhile, the trilogy of OPUS shares a similar narrative manner, namely unfolding the story through interactive items, dialogues and comments. Especially in the Chinese Edition, itâs brilliant to use classical Chinese both in ancient ruins and in everyday talk (as idioms), and it really makes me feel like reading an ancient myth. Unveiling the truth of the current world and its past is enjoyable, it reminds me of the happy hours spent in VA-11 (another great visual novel). Besides, itâs hard to believe that the OST of an indie game is composed of nearly 140 songs and they are of high quality!Lastly, the mechanism of game isnât obscure so itâs pretty suitable for those who are more interested in the story rather than puzzle solving (but the puzzle solving part is also well-made!).Thanks for the invaluable experience provided by âEcho Of Starsongâ, and Iâm really respect for SIGONOâs diligence in developing OPUS series. And thanks for my friend sending the game copy as a gift right after the release :D. Looking forward to the next OPUS!",positive

Assassin's Creed Valhalla,Comes 2 years late to Steam without basic steam features implemented. When asked about it they double down on their decision. Why even bother bringing it to Steam to begin with?,negative
Assassin's Creed Valhalla,"It feels weird to say that there is ""too much"" game but it feels like a pretty bloated game with a lot to do sure, but a lot of it is grinding and the same few mission repeating over and over. It seriously took me 12 hours to get through the prologue. But it's very beautiful though, and if you can get over the grindyness you might enjoy it. Those first 12 hours exploring the nice mountains of Norway was nice. Makes me kinda wish the game stayed around there. Also why the hell is there a cash shop in a single player game that you're still selling for full price?!",negative
Assassin's Creed Valhalla,"I am almost 60 hours into the game at this point. It is a very *grueling* experience. I am not even half way through the main stor. Spoilers below.I don't care about the lack of achievements. I don't care about it not being a sneaky AC Game. I can respect this game as an RPG with elements of the AC World during the Viking Raids of England. I don't even necessarily care that the game can't seem to decide if it's Isu technology or if magick is actually real (At this point I'm leaning somewhere near the latter).Issue #1: The Main storyline is WAY too long and way too repetitive. I'm sorry but I really have no incentive to want to explore the world and help EVERY SINGLE little count or ealdorman in England just so I can beat the game. And that's not even including the missions in Asgard and Jotunheim through Valka. To put into perspective how many quests there are in the main storyline, I lost count at around 112-ish. These quests can range from ""Go to Randvi and tell her you finishes the last story arc"" to ""Find 8 unmarked locations at the map and kill people and find supplies"" I enjoyed Origins on my Xbox One. I loved Egypt, I loved following Bayek's tale of revenge. There was a clear goal that was driving you, the death of his son and getting justice for that. With Eivor I don't even know what I am doing at this point. Like: We have the support of like 6 kings or ealdormans and like I don't really know WHO THE BAD GUYS ARE! In theory, the order of ancients are the bad guys but the game never really makes it a priority to hunt them down (there's also like no real reason for me to want to hunt them down. They haven't DONE anything to Eivor and there's no real reward, as far as I can tell, for killing them all), they're really a secondary concern to the acquiring of alliances, but at this point there isn't a point to collecting alliances. There are no immediate threats to Eivor or their clan. At the beginning, it made sense for Eivor to ally with Grantebridge or Seek out the Ragnarsons, that was in line with the original goal of establishing a home for the clan. But at that point the clan is pretty safe all things considered so there isn't really any pressure at this point anymore. Also the game is REALLY INSISTENT on Eivor and Sigurd being angry and hateful to fulfill Valka's prophecy but there hasn't really been enough development, to me at this point, for them to want to be this close to coming to blows.Issue #2: The World feels empty and at the same time cluttered with useless junk. There are many collectibles in the world of AC Valhalla, and at the point I'm at in the game they are all useless. I don't have a need to upgrade my gear because I have not faced enemies that have forced me to reconsider my strategy or way of fighting, I haven't reached a blocking point, in fact I'm TOO Strong at this point. None of the armors or wealths or mysteries interest me anymore. They don't reward me anything of value. I understand that part of this is to encourage players to explore, but what's the point? I see why people WANT the achievements, because this would make it worth it, but I would take anything for collecting all of the mysteries, artifacts and wealth points in a certain number of places. The armor isn't really that good compared to the upgraded berserkir armor. At the same time, the world doesn't make you feel like you're in it, it makes you feel like you're the center of it. Nothing happens without Eivor, the all powerful ubermensch who can literally be the difference between an army winning a battle and just losing. No one does anything without you. Sure there are some funny voicelines in cities and such, but the world doesn't feel alive. Even the mysteries, which are meant to be these sort of side quests are just so boring and insignificant, they are only worth doing when they give you a key to get some supplies you desperately need to build one more part of your settlement.Issue #3: The Legendary weapons are very underwhelming. These are meant to be the ""Weapons of Gods and Heroes"". They feel like weapons in skyrim that you enchanted with shock damage... It would be cool I guess if the weapons looked a bit more impressive or if they had like actually good special abilities aside from ""Pew pew lightning, *stuns for like a second*""The final thing I want to note is that, it feels like some of the writing and items are just there as fan service. Like, this game has a LOT of fan service. Kassandra didn't need to be in the game, you could've avoided that entirely, they did it because ""OMG LOOK IT'S THE CHARACTER FROM THE LAST GAME!!!!"" And you didn't need to make the Egypt armor from the Wrath of the Druids DLC literally just be partially based on Bayek's armor...All of this said... I want to praise it a bit as well. Eivor's character is interesting and there are good moments where their qualities shine through, One of the best ways is at the beginning, Eivor places the hidden blade over their wrist and says ""Why would I want to hide such a weapon?"" This is really fascinating on many levels: It sets up that Eivor is not a fan of hiding their power, it says something about the culture Eivor comes from, it sets out that Eivor is not the sneaky type, they're a warrior and proud of it and they want everyone to know they're proud of this fact. Eivor also manages to do it without seeming, to me at least, overly arrogant and self righteous. I think this is because Eivor really goes out of their way, at least out I play them, to do the right thing and find BETTER solutions than the problems present.One of the best storylines in this game is the Wrath of the Druids DLC. Eivor gets a message to meet the King of dublin, their cousin Bairid and his son Sicfrith. Bairid asks Eivor to help him gain the favor of the High King of Ireland, a godly man who hates Pagans and Vikings on account of them killing his father. In doing so, you are roped into building up Dublin as a center of trade and in trying to stop a cult of druids who are trying to kill the High King of Ireland and Bairid. Along the way you meet one of the Good Druids, the High Poetess and you start to see this tension between the christians and pagans in Ireland. Eventually you go hunt down all of the Evil Druid cult leaders and the last mission is killing the leader. Your reward for killing all of these leaders is the legendary Gae Bolg, the weapon of Cu Chulainn. Afterwards the kings of Ireland call a meeting with the High King and they all decide to do an inquisition to purge the island of all of the Druids. The High Poetess storms off and attempts to unleash hell upon the isle and kill the High King, You then either kill her or spare her life, in which case she flees. the High King is convinced of his faults and calls of the Inquisition. The story ends with you and Sicfrith mourning Bairid who died in the course of the war trying to earn the favor of his High King.THIS IS WHAT A STORY SHOULD BE LIKE. It's not Oscar winning by any means, but it doesn't force you to win the favor of every single gods damned lord in England, AND THEN some quests with the gods.I think it would've been better for all of the alliances to be optional and instead maybe make them simplified or offer a reward for creating all of these alliances like special merchants or buildings for Raventhorpe or maybe a special set of armor or something. Kind of like the Templar Hunt missions in AC4.Anyways tl;dr:Stunning VisualsGreat Voice ActorsTerrible StoryLong StoryBoring StoryDisappointing Legendary WeaponsEmpty, Cluttered, Boring world",negative
Assassin's Creed Valhalla,"Okay, here's the thing.The game itself is alright. Pretty decent open world exploration and combat. Put its a definite downgrade from the last couple entries gameplay wise and the story is showing a LOT of wear and tear from trying to fit AC into the RPG Mold.-The Skill tree is so meandering and inefficient its confusing to try to make a good build. Luckily you eventually get some many skill points you kinda brute force a good build regardless, especially at lower skill levels. We need a return to at least the Odyssey/Origins level where there were separate skill trees that made it a lot easier to decide to specialize in a specific playstyle.-Stealth seems a lot harder to pull off. Not enough places to hide, too many wide thoroughfares, that type of thing. Unless you deliberately set stealth to easy, soldiers seem to notice you immediately, and even then its easier to be noticed than not. Even as an RPG, Stealth should be a very supported level of playstyle in AC.-The Weird MMOification of AC games continues apace. All of these dailies and microtransactions for single-player game stuff, and the pressure to log on every day to farm Opals and check the vendor for stuff you will with the siren song of opening the real cash store and grabbing it there instead, for a game you will probably finish and abandon forever in no more than 100 hours or so and certainly wont play long enough to buy a full cash armor set with Opals, if only because all pieces likely wont appear on the Opal store and if they do, you might miss it because you decided to play another game or couldnt game at all that day.-The Viking Story is... kind of iffy, theme-wise. Listen, there's not really an easy way to make the Vikings the Good Guys. For better or for worse, they are invaders and colonists. Trying to make them decent hardworking folks just looking for a new land just kind of... falls flat, in the face of that? Cant make me a dude just looking for peace when Im out here raiding villages and monasteries for loot. I get that not every game has you play as the good guys, but I appreciate a little themeatic clarity that just isnt coming across in this game. These dudes are raiders, like it or not.-The ""Long Term"" Romances are so flat I kinda just wish they hadnt been included? Also the story feels like you were definitely supposed to romance Randvi for it to make sense. I didnt feel any real connection to Randvi, so I romanced Petra instead, and a few storylines just make a LOT less sense that way. I loved some of the romance options in Odyssey/Valhalla, don't get me wrong, but if you're not gonna at least give me Bioware level attention to this stuff, just cut it out or give me one canon romance the storyline leads toward.-Honestly, in general most of the choices were kind of iffy. They lead to weird changes in the narrative, some where its obvious the game expected you to make the other choice, so the choice you made just kinda... petered out? Or the game rushed bullheadedly along as if you'd chosen the other choice, narrative-wise? Not every game needs to be a ""Choice"" RPG, and Valhalla has definitely tipped me full on into the ""AC does not need to be a 'your choices matter'"" RPG camp. I dont need to make narrative choices, just let me watch Edward Kenway be an â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and destroy his personal life completely while I help him kill soldiers and pursue treasure that should have been left buried, you hear?-The Order of the Ancients storyline was especially weak. As a non-Assassin, Eivor's choice to go after the Order was about the weakest its ever been. She needed a personal stake, she didnt have one, so the whole thing felt flat, a checklist to mark off rather than a quest to bring order or seek vegeance or etc as it has been for most of the other MCs.-Just Make Lady Eivor the only Eivor you cowards. She was superior anyway, and it feels like trying to ""Have your cake and eat it too"" to make her the canon Eivor but also let people play as a Dude. Not like you're gonna let us play Lady!Basim in Mirage are you? Just let a Lady have the spotlight instead of this cowardly ""Well the lady is canon but you can play as a dude if you think she has cooties""-After a while, Titanium becomes a massive bottleneck. If I want to upgrade even one set of armor and weapons, I have to go around buying Titanium off vendors or tracking down treasure chests. Annoying side quest options.-There's no less than two side-quests/""Game Modes"" where I can't use the weapons, armor, and skills I've ground for for dozens of hours, and where the content is implied to be ""Endless."" Let Single-Player games END, y'all. Sometimes I just wanna spend 50-100 hours clearing out a big map full of interesting stuff and jet to the next thing in my games library, and that's FINE.On the plus side:-River raiding is fun. There's too little of it in the overworld, but luckily you can get a whole side quest where you open up special river maps. Do wish there was a little more variety on these maps, a little tougher enemies, but you know. Fun storming a castle with a bunch of cool Jomsvikings.-Still a lot of solid open world combat and areas to explore.-A few of the weapons are pretty fun to play around with.Anyway, yeah, I know, Haha, look at Thumbs Down girl with 115 hours played, but I couldnt in good faith give this a Thumbs up. Its solid enough if you've liked the last couple AC Series entries, but a lot of the concepts are showing their age.",negative

Assassin's Creed Valhalla,"Exhausting and DisappointingI wanted to love this game, and for the first 10 hours of gameplay, I was hooked by the game, but then the problem started to reveal itself. The main issue I had with the game was the narrative structure. It is ""exhausting"" and diminishes the motivation to finish the game. Plus, the dead open world doesn't feel as lively and exciting to explore as Origins or Odyssey, which is disappointing.If you're really into Viking stuff, you're in for a treat. But if you need a game that doesn't feel like a chore when you get back from real-life work, this is not the game for you. This game doesn't even make RPG grinding fun.

Assassin's Creed Valhalla,"You know that sequence from Malcolm in the Middle where Hal tries to fix the garage lightbulb, so he goes to grab a spare, but the shelf holding them is wobbly? So then he gets a screwdriver to fix the shelf but the tool drawer is squeaky so of course he grabs some lubricant but the can is empty and so he goes to the store but the car is making a funny noise.... Hey, what the â¥â¥â¥â¥ was I doing even?Valhalla is essentially that experience, and at around 25 hours I think imma call this one. For a long time now Ubi has really doubled down on the idea that more content = better game, and this has never been more evident than here. Perhaps like some of you reading this now, as a person with a limited amount of time on Earth I'd strongly posit the contrary.None of this is helped by the way the game is structured. Seemingly its the typical open world formula, but the content is fairly rigidly dosed out so you really don't have any choice in what order or when story beats unfold. The game will gatekeep those choices based on level or other unlockable bits of progression.So I enountered an ostensibly significant character. She had a unique design and a celebrity VO by Shohreh Aghdashloo. I use the actor's name instead of the character's, because like pretty much everyone else in the game I already forgot what it was.Anyway, what I do remember is that there were mad hints about a fascinating backstory to her, and it really seemed like the game was working up to dropping some fresh Assassin lore.By this time my patience with Valhalla was wearing thin, so I really sat up and started to pay attention, and play actively for a change. We went through a fairly elaborate infiltration and assassination, and then she just â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ right off?If only the writing wasnt such bloated, somniferous drivel this could have been a gotyA Screenshot of Assassin's Creed ValhallaBy:PoopfeelsI have a strong feeling that her narrative arc continues once I grind out an appropriate amount of levels, or unlock the required territory on the map, but man, this tease and let down was such a perfect encapsulation of the core issue with this game. The devs couldn't care less about telling a good story. They just want you on the hamster wheel for long enough that you'll buy some of the crap from the ingame store. Maybe she shows up later, maybe she doesn't, I'll probably never find out.I'd say that 70% of all the stuff that happened during my playthrough was just breadcrumbs. A sugartrail to get you playing more. It's a vapid excuse for the game to exist around it, as opposed to an inherently well written and gratifying narrative that serves itself.The characters are all megabland and forgettable, so it all just meshes into a blur. Every once in a while something mildly interesting happens, but then it settles back into a monotonous and comfortable rhythm.To be completely honest if you're in the right mindset and specifically craving this type of passive / zen gaming experience, it can be OK. But the bloat is very, very real. This is quintessential present day Ubisoft busywork, spread across an expansive and gorgeous map.enjoying the british countryside on my historically accurate battle unicornA Screenshot of Assassin's Creed ValhallaBy:PoopfeelsThere's little glimpses of more interesting writing and bits of fantastic environmental storytelling, like that guy with the axe in his head or the king of the tiny island in the middle of the river, but these bits of interesting content are completely drowned out by the hodgepodge verbosity of... Pretty much everything else in the game.This really sucks too, because the core gameplay is very fun and the world is beautiful. All they had to do was trim down all the timewaste bloat and focus on the writing. Valhalla could have been a modern classic. As it stands, this is one of the most overwritten games I've ever came across.At any point in my playthrough, I'd have probably struggled to tell you what the hell I was doing, and to what end. Just follow the markers on the map, and let your brain enter a vegetative state. It's the video game equivalent of binging on McDonalds.This is the most streamlined the franchise has ever been, for better or worse. Combat is fun and arcadey, stealth is ezpz, any semblance of realism has long since vanished from this series.

Assassin's Creed Valhalla,"Assassin's Creed Valhalla commits a grave sin. It didn't kill off a beloved character nor was it a buggy mess on launch. The fault with this game is much simpler than that--It's really, REALLY, effing boring.I will say, I have been an AC fan since the first game came out. I remember being excited for the launch and enthralled with Altair and his secretive clan of assassins. I loved the intrigue of slowly unraveling the bigger picture of the story as each new installment came out. Over the years the vision for where the franchise was going changed, and the games changed with them. Some of these changes were good, most were not. AC Valhalla represents the culmination of what is wrong with the modern take on Assassin's Creed games.What does one expect from an Assassin's Creed game? Letâs get to basics, cause by god we're gonna need 'em.1) The main character is an Assassin and/or joins the order at some point.=> Eivor is pointedly NOT an Assassin, never intends to become one, flat out says that he/she doesn't really have much interest in their cause beyond using the assassins as allies. I have not completed this game at time of writing, however it is my understanding that this does not change. In fact, while Eivor may have the hidden blade, they do not keep it actually hidden, opting instead to wear it like glorified brass knuckles and use it in head-on attacks.2) The main character will complete assassinations on high profile targets that involve some stealth combat.=> There is stealth combat in this game. There are not, however, many opportunities to use it. The main story does not have the assassination targets as an objective, instead this game went the route of AC Odyssey and opted for a tree of mystery-unraveling to unveil the big players of the organization. In Odyssey that system worked with the story and was at least partially relevant to what was happening. Those characters had a reason to hate the members of the cult and want to  hunt them down. In Valhalla? I have no idea why I would bother taking down the Templar figures because Eivor isnât even an Assassin. They want power and glory, sure, but that's such a weak motivator that it doesnât keep the playerâs interest for long.  Eivor (as a Viking) goes for a straightforward âraid and pillageâ style of fighting so during missions the game often immediately puts you in combat and thus eliminates the possibility of a stealthy approach. Large scale castle raids are played this way as well. Eivor is NOT an Assassin.3) There is a complex and engaging story.=> This game has a good 3-4 hours in the beginning where it starts to feel like they are building a complex narrative with key players that I could buy into. Then, instead of building on that, they use it as a call to the heroâs journey and dump you smack dab in the middle of what I have begun to call the âopen world grindâ. Do you enjoy following objectives to the next place you need to pillage? Opening every chest to get generic âsuppliesâ so you can push a button back at your village and upgrade a shop? Killing wild animals and breaking rocks so you can fuel the upgrade machine? No? Then donât bother playing. The game is so desperate to show the player that they have an open world to explore that they didnât stop to write in a reason for me to do so beyond endless tiers of upgrades. The missions are also uninteresting. Go here, kill some bad guys, go there, talk to someone, etc.4) The game will have parkour movement that will be used in creative ways for infiltration or assassinations.=> This game has parkour movement. It has unbelievable parkour movement. You can climb anything and everything, effortlessly  latching onto a flat wall with your spiked gloves or something I suppose because thereâs clearly no other explanation. Look, far be it from me to advocate for less freedom of movement, but I remember when parkour in games felt cool because it had some limitations that required different gear, or an upgrade, or--I donât know--some mild puzzling to figure out how to get to where you wanted to be. It feels so lifeless and uninteresting to be able to climb all over everything like a spider-monkey without even earning it. And again--Eivor is NOT AN ASSASSIN. Why do they just know how to do this? And even putting all I have said aside, stealth and parkour just isnât super relevant to completing objectives in AC Valhalla. Story missions are straightforward assault battles.5) Interesting setting.=> This reason is much more subjective, but honestly I think itâs still a valid point for reasons Iâll expand upon. Vikings just feelâ¦very done as a concept right now, in my opinion. Obviously this game was conceptualized years ago, but it just doesnât hit as an unexplored interesting locale and time period to set an AC game. However even beyond my opinion, the color palette is definitely limited by this setting. I was getting flashbacks to the drab, boring and ugly locations in Assassinâs Creed 3, and thatâs not a good thing. The game is pitched as a Viking raider vs English townspeople struggle for power but somehow also tries to convince me that the Vikings were the good guys and all of the people who lived on that land are corrupt. Like ok sure the king might be selfish and a despot but was the farmer and his family? You know, the one I just mugged for supplies during a raid? Iâm not saying that the main character of a game has to be a good guy but when you try and convince me they are while also asking me to pillage towns it just rings hollow.There is more I could say that I haven't even touched on (pointless boat transit, equally pointless city management systems, etc.), but this review is already quite long and I donât want it to double in length. I guess what you should know is:TL;DR--Valhalla is an extremely boring game that fails to give the player any motivation to keep playing it. It is an aimless and drab experience of half-considered systems and features that feel shoved-in to justify the title of Assassinâs Creed. It did not need to be an Assassinâs Creed game, nor was it compelling enough to have existed as a standalone title. It is a vapid example of a game that might be designed by some corporate AI that seeks to check off boxes rather than make something truly interesting.",negative
Assassin's Creed Valhalla,"this game represents everything wrong with modern ubisoft. everything is shallow, it has so much copy paste from every other mediocre ubisoft game in the past 10 years. there are moments when you'll have fun but on the grand scale, the game is so so mediocre. its like ubisoft heads dont even understand what video games are anymore. they think they're just some kind of vehicle for addictive dopamine mechanics. zero art. and i dont blame the devs on the ground floor making the game, its just contaminated with ubisoft stupidity. the game has a ridiculous amount of content but none of it will stay with you. assassins creed valhalla is the fast food of gaming. if you need to play it, wait for a deep sale. otherwise stay away.EDIT: Some people complaining about my playtime.

Assassin's Creed Valhalla,"Unfortunately a big disappointmentI can't recommend this game. I guess it's fine to play it just once. After Origins and Odyssey, which were both superb games, I expected much more from AC Valhalla, but sadly I found it to be a downgrade from previous games, in almost every aspect.Short-story: Valhalla is not so fun compared to its predecessors, and much more forgettable. Also, it borrows too much from the older games.Below I will leave some hints on what to expect, based on my opinion after completing the game:- Graphics look good and the viking-theme is interesting, but the setting is not better than Ancient Egypt or Greece; of course this would not be a problem IF all this big map wouldn't look the same- Following the above, there are a lot of points of interest to complete, which should encourage the player to explore them, however they are just too repetitive and get boring quite quickly. Therefore, I would say that exploration is not rewarded enough, both visually (e.g. nice new places to discover) and as in-game rewards (e.g. new gear); some view points are in the middle of nowhere, far from anything, and seem to be placed randomly- Another bad/frustrating element about the exploration/looting would be that any chest and other insignificant collectible is made as a puzzle, which is not quite funny after a while- The game seems just too easy; I understand that it is made for the large public, but higher difficulties just make the game more time-consuming and not harder, at least in my opinion- I did not enjoy the boring dialogues, repetitive quests and some of the voice acting; characters are easy to forget, I skipped a lot!- Stealth feels broken: sometimes is works, sometimes it behaves strangely (e.g you can be seen through obstacles, detected from afar, not spotted at all)- The combat: I'll just say it's for sure worse than in Origins/Odyssey- Furthermore, the skill tree seems complicated and challenging at first, which would be a good thing for an RPG, but they really don't matter that much and are just small perks; some of the skills are special abilities, still most of them just improve your stats and you won't really notice any difference; I personally didn't like the leveling system (one quest gives you 2 skills points to spend). Last but not least, in the end you get all the skills so the feeling of building your character according to your playstyle is gone- The game crashes constantly and this seems to be a common problem that has not been solved for quite a long time, despite of many complaints; UBI launcher has problems - constantly not being able to sync, logging out and sending verification emails without a reason- There are quite a few bugs and glitches, nothing too serious, but together with the crashes and long loading times it can get frustrating- No achievements on steam; while this is not a big deal for me, I realized that the community complained and I approve that there is no reason why they wouldn't add them- Weird camera angles and focus sometimesNow some good things:- Music is still good, still not at the same level as previous 2 titles- Horse mechanics seem to be improved, training is a good idea but it needs more elements- Both male and female main characters are likeable and seem equal this time- Fps is constant and the game runs well (besides the crashes and long loading times)- Character customization is fine, I had a lot of in-game currency to purchase what I wanted from the merchant; you can get as free rewards items that you will normally have to pay for, also there are some bonus rewards that you can get with UBI credits and you have a lot of options regarding paid stuff.Verdict:I do not recommend it. I can't say that you must avoid it, you may give it a try, I'm sure some will like it, just don't have high expectations like I had. Anyway, I would not pay the full price but wait for a sale.Please note that I did not try the DLCs and do not plan to get them. My opinion is that their price is too high, just to extend the game that is. Basic version is already big, try it and then get the DLCs (on sale!), if you really liked it.There is more to be told about the game, but this review is already quite long and I hope it's enough for an opinion. I also hope that I don't seem to be complaining too much but sadly that is my honest opinion.Good luck and have fun! Comment section is opened for any questions.",negative

Assassin's Creed Valhalla,"I have played 100+ hrs on Playstation and I've seen 100% of the base game. It was a mistakeAC Valhalla is not a bad game, but it's not Assasins Creed...Ubisoft could have just named this game ""Valhalla"" and it would be better, but it's Ubisoft so no, lets milk the name. A lot of boring quests, repetitive open world missions, bland characters, mediocre combat, bugs glitches and on PC I really feel that the game was made to be played with a controller, with keyboard and mouse it's very clunky. Audio is terrible, high music and effects, very low dialogue and dialogue boost option in settings doesn't help. Loading times are pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ long compared to the PS5s for some reason and my PC has faster storage than the PS5, so it's probably intentional.DENUVO...why?Story is ok, gets boring after a while, cause it's mostly the same stuff. One think I really liked was the music in this game, they did an amazing job with the OST with Einar Selvik.2 years after release, the game finally came to Steam, without achievements, no steam cloud saves, no actual steam features like trading cards (Origins and Odyssey both released with those things). I wonder what's even the point of releasing this game on Steam. Oh wait I know, basically a cash grab. To be honest it is expected form Ubisoft and I knew all of these things before I got the game, still it's frustrating. Every time I close the game the Ubisoft â¥â¥â¥â¥ Connect launcher tells me that I've been logged out due to inactivity and I gotta re-enter my credentials. When I buy a game from Steam I expect to be able to play it if I have only Steam installed, what's the point of having a million game launchers for each title? The biggest problem is that the Ubisoft app is garbage. If I wanted to play the game from there I would have bought it on the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ app, not on Steam. Currently Ubisoft employees are deleting steam discussions, where people are compaining about the missing features for the game. That's what they do in their free time, cause obviously making games is so easy, just copy and paste and boom a 70$ AAA title.I definitely do NOT RECOMMEND AC Valhalla. Even if all of the features were not missing and the game was released on Steam properly I just do not think that it is worth your time. Ubisoft is so â¥â¥â¥â¥ and it's been â¥â¥â¥â¥ for more than 7 years with their AC wannabe RPG games. I hope the next one is better",negative
Assassin's Creed Valhalla,"I played this game on Ubisoft connect before it came to steam and was happy when they announced it was coming to steam even if it is 2 years late. Im not a big fan of the new AC games, but I would say its much better than odyssey, but not as good as origins.Sadly I cannot recommend this game right now, as its release on steam seems like more of a cash grab than an actual thoughtful release. There is no steam achievements, trading cards or any of the steam features that both origins and odyssey had on steam. And to make things worse, Ubisoft devs are banning and deleting discussion threads in the steam forums that dare to criticize these missing features.It makes Ubisoft look really bad when their return to steam after 3 years is a low effort steam release, and their devs going out of there way to silence the steam users who expected better after waiting 2 years for this game. It feels like a spit in the face.Also Ubisoft connect is a buggy, glitchy piece of trash. When origins and odyssey released they were still using uplay, which while not ideal, could be mostly ignored as it just opened in the background, but since valhalla released, ubisoft ""upgraded"" to ubisoft connect which is still plagued with issues after years. It randomly logs me out my account every time I quit the game because it ""can't upload save game to the cloud"", and every time I open Ubi connect I have to give it permission to make changes to my PC 3 times before it will open. These and a bunch of other bugs make it horrible to use and theres really no reason for it to exist at all other than for Ubi to spy on their users and collect user data.Do better Ubisoft.",negative
Assassin's Creed Valhalla,"Assassinâs Creed: Valhalla is the ultimate example for a decent 15-20h game thatâs artificially bloated to last the player at least 65+h even when rushing the main story, resulting in an incredibly draining experience that seems to drag on foreverAs the thirdAssassinâs Creedtitle to follow the action-RPG direction that was first introduced byAssassinâs Creed: Originsback in 2017, 2020âsAssassinâs Creed: Valhallashouldâve been the game to  improve upon the flaws and deliver the ultimate version of the formula. Instead,Assassinâs Creed: Valhallafeels like publisher Ubisoft learned all the wrong lessons from the previous twoAssassinâs Creedgames and subsequently doubled down on the worst design choices. This is all the more frustrating because at its core,Assassinâs Creed: Valhalladoes have the potential to be an enjoyable â but unfortunately, nearly all of it is drowned by a crushing amount of âquantity over qualityâ-type content.To provide the necessary framework for this review, letâs take a look at how the amount of content changed across the threeAssassinâs Creedaction-RPG titles (Origins,Odyssey&Valhalla) first. WhenOriginsreleased, it was the biggestAssassinâs Creedtitle so far, with amap size of 92kmÂ²/35,5miÂ², 183 quests and 78 viewpoints[www.gamepressure.com]â I considered it amuch fun & mostly needed overhaul for the long-running franchisebut noted the unfortunate need to grind side-content for levels. Next,Odysseywent on to basically double all of these values, which resulted in an experience I calledâthe Origins-formula stretched way too thin through the massive amount of ever-the-same content if offers.âAnd finally, thereâsAssassinâs Creed: Valhallaâ unsurprisingly, the map size and quest amount is upped once again, but interestingly, on paper itâs actually not by a lot (~11% more quests, ~17% bigger map). However, in practice youâll probably findAssassinâs Creed: Valhallato be even more of a slog thanOdysseyâ at least if youâre interested in completing the story.One of the biggest changes present inAssassinâs Creed: Valhallacompared to the previous two franchise entries would be the overall story quest structure. While the base game ofAssassinâs Creed: Odysseyoffered three storylines - one âmainâ quest (your âOdysseyâ), one tied to exposing + assassinating all members of the Order of the Ancients and one tied to the mythical side of the game â for the player to complete,Assassinâs Creed: Valhallaoffers a similar structure, with the major difference that the âmain questâ is tied to conquering all major twenty-one territories on the gameâs various map. This is done by completing a story arc in each territory, which consists out of multiple quests â in total, youâre looking at a whopping 139 (!) main missions youâll need to complete for the full story, plus additional missions added through free updates that serve as a final chapter as well as tie-ins to otherAssassinâs Creedtitles. This is also a good point to point out that the game also received three paid expansions, all with their own additional story missions.Now, 139+ main missions is definitely an intimidating number but by itself, it doesnât mean much if the quality of the quests is high enough. The problem is that Ubisoft only managed to achieve such a high number of âmain storyâ quests by basically turning almost every possible quest of the game into one â as a result, youâll find that there are almost no side quests to complete except for âworld eventsâ, which amount to 2min micro âquestsâ spread across the map. While there is a central story thread woven throughout some of the 21 story arcs, the vast majority of the time youâre basically busy doing side errands for current or future territory leaders in order to forge an alliance. In every other game, the central story arcs wouldâve been separated from those that barely make an impact on the plot, turning them into optional side content instead â but not here, as Ubisoft wants a game that lasts you at least 65+h, even if youâre mostly rushing through the story. Unsurprisingly, this also ruins the pacing of the story completely, as youâre going from major story developments to hunting bears or collecting shards.Further problems of this approach include the introduction of many forgettable characters that barely make an impact as well as the resulting lack of character development for actually important ones. Admittedly, there are some positively surprising developments happening near the end of the game, but they canât outweigh the sheer amount of bad story arcs that feel like filler side story material. As youâre constantly drowned in unnecessary story arcs repeating similar plot structures, another problem arises: The gameplay loop ofAssassinâs Creed: Valhallawasnât built for a lengthy game like it.Without the space to go into details here, the gameplay loop ofAssassinâs Creed: Valhallaboils down to a refined version of theOriginsformula, which was already improved upon inOdyssey. The two most notable changes include a massively expanded skill tree, which only maintains it size by offering a lot of boring stat upgrades (e.g. +3 resistance to light attacks) instead of constantly rewarding a level up with actually new skills, as well as changes to the loot system: Instead of constantly receiving new and better equipment like before,Assassinâs Creed: Valhallaonly rewards you with each individual gear piece/weapon once â if you want to increase its power, youâll have to use materials to upgrade it. Unfortunately, as the game isnât too generous with crafting materials unless you put in the time, this means that youâre not able to experiment with new gear/weapons that much if youâve already chosen to upgrade certain pieces.As to why the gameplay loop doesnât work for a game as lengthy as this: Itâs simply not deep enough. Even if we ignore longevity problems like encountering the same few enemy types and minigames or the large amount of recycled/empty locations, both the combat and the assassinations repeatedly require you to perform the same motions, with no reason/opportunity to mix things up. Once you reached a certain level a few hours into the game, every gameplay mechanic is going to feel familiar and wonât gain any additional depth.Assassinâs Creed: Valhallasimply feels like a decent 15-20h game in terms of story and gameplay that was forcefully expanded into a 65+h monstrosity, which sucks all the fun out of the experience through painful repetition and endlessly dragging things out.Concluding, Iâd recommendAssassinâs Creed: Valhallaonly to the most dedicated fans of the action-RPG titles in the franchise. While there is a decent game hiding somewhere between all the bloat, seeing the story to its end will require you to engage with the same type of content and forgettable quests for a long. long time - to the point where playing the game almost feels like work. If you value your time, think twice before purchasing â or at least plan on taking adequate breaks.",negative
Assassin's Creed Valhalla,"Disclaimer:I played and finished this game on Epic (78hr playtime), and bought the game here so I could leave this review where people might actually see it.I wish this game wasjustbad. I wish it was the standard low effort AAA trash. A thing leaves your mind so quickly when itâs unremarkable and makes no impression, and I wouldnât even be compelled to write about it if it wasjusta bad game. But Assassinâs Creed Valhalla is not a bad game, it is a painfully, heartbreakingly, mediocre one. Itâs worse than bad. Because it promises to be good, and it should be. Because I canât even begin to fathom the monumental amount of effort and care that went into crafting a world and setting that Ishouldbe entirely entranced with, and I have never really experienced a game with such a vast scale in both locale and narrative. Yet the end product is still, against all odds, a poorly designed and incredibly over-bloated game.There are at most, and Iâm really not exaggerating this, about4 hoursmaximum of actually interesting narrative content in this game which has somehow been strewn across 60 hours of lacklustre, undriven, pointless and repetitive gameplay (60 hours is thelowerend by the way, if you ignore basically all of the hundreds of near-useless collectables and side-ventures). Most of the interesting narrative occurs at theENDof the game. There are several points in the main progression where the gaps between interesting story beats are separated by, without hyperbole,16 hoursof filler arcs. That is longer than some of the earlier AC games in theirentirety.Just. On. Filler.Filler story that has no bearing and no connection to any of the actual interesting plot. It honestly boggles the mind how the narrative structure and design of this game actually made it through several rounds of production.My best bet for where this game lost its footing is very simple and boils down to this: Assassinâs Creed Valhalla was made by a mis-managed group of teams that, in their own right are obviously incredibly skilled developers, but as a conglomerate very clearly did not talk to each other and collaborate, at all, during production. This is the best, most concise way I can describe the dull ache this game will leave you with, as what you will find is a game filled with a hundred different things to do and stories to tell, but no cohesion or unifying foundation to hold them together, and no reason to explore any of it.Completing this game was painful, a self-flagellation and a rot that would not leave me until I finished it at least once and could shelve it for all eternity. And now I am free.Play this only if you are a die-hard fan of the series, or if you are clinically obsessed with Vikings, anything less will be a sincere waste of your time.With love,A clinically viking-obsessed, die-hard fan of the series",negative

Assassin's Creed Valhalla,"The reviews complaining about achievements drown out the noise of actual complains about the game.Valhalla is seriously flawed. In the first 10 hours you have seen basically the entire game.+ Jank everywhere. Animations don't connect and characters glitch out in cutscenes all the time. You cannot play the game for more than 10 minutes without SOMETHING going wrong. Its not fallout76, but it's close.+ The combat is very basic r1r2 spam, and the game lasts 200 hours. You cannot build a 200 hour game that mostly involves combat on an r1r2 spam system.+ Difficulty is nonexistent. 30 hours in I'm basically one shotting every mob that's not elite. Not even in bossfights do I come close to dying. My power level is 206 and I can beat 340 power level zones ez. The game lasts 200 hours but there is no difficulty.+ The main story is also nonexistent. You just move from zone to zone and get involved in a politics arc that introduces and removes characters in about ~120 minutes. You cannot care for anyone because they are gone SO quickly from the picture. Never to be seen again until the final confrontation.If Valhalla was a 20 hour game, all of this would be fine. It is absolutely terrible for a 200 hour game. I love Odyssey. I love Origins. Valhalla can go die in a fire.",negative
Assassin's Creed Valhalla,"I found it to be extremely repetitive. Missions look pretty much the same, they are only in different locations, and those locations look almost the same. Not much detail was invested in natural diversity, so England and Vinland look quite alike. The only reason I kept playing through it is because I was interested to see where the story goes, and as far as the story it is 8.5/10 from me. However, even though with some great visuals and amazing fight sequences, I was underwhelmed. If you really have no other options, give this game a try. If it is on some amazing sale, give it a try. In any other situation, find something else to spend your time on.",negative
Assassin's Creed Valhalla,"Spent a decent chunk of time on this game now. Was thoroughly enjoying it despite hearing negative opinions. However, got halfway through exploring England when my game suddenly began to constantly just shut down of its own accord. Now it does it on average every 15 minutes. Can barely complete a raid in that time. For that reason I don't recommend.  Also, there are certain areas you cant access without reaching that point in the campaign. for example the interior of a castle. So, you can see theres a piece of Equipment inside on your map and you might spend a solid 30 mins trying to work out a sneaky way in only to discover you could actually never get in without progressing story.

Assassin's Creed Valhalla,"I will continue to play this game to completion, but cannot recommend it. Whereas I thought the world of AC Odyssey was interesting the world of AC Valhalla is just a weird, almost childish, rendition of the period.It's very bizarre when Eivor in one instance raids a village for some supplies, killing dozens of warriors, but then in the next reviles murder in some world event (as an example: Eivor at one point chastises Ivarr for enjoying raiding too much....a viking, a person that believes a warriors death is his way to Valhalla, enjoys fighting....too...much). The vikings themselves do not murder civilians, let alone take any slaves, despite the fact this was expected of viking raids during the period. The vikings are depicted as oddly progressive in their morals and attitudes while the Saxons themselves are often depicted as backwards and comically savage - even though the reversal is more closer (though not entirely) to reality. I suspect the reason for this is because Ubisoft doesn't have the stomach to handle such a period with authenticity with its Disneyesque obsession with making games that ""speak modern audiences"" (N.B.: politically fashionable types)  and because Ubisoft could not square the circle that is making a main character a viking while also making the main character relatable and likeable to the player. Regardless, it results in a watered down and weird experience.I could always look past on the ridiculous elements of the post-Origins AC games (the absurd armour, weapons and fantastical elements) because Origins and Odyssey managed to depict a believeable world despite however lax in historical accuracy, but Valhalla fails in that. If Ubisoft did not want to depict the vikings in all their savagery then they should have simply depicted the period from the point of view of the Saxons and kept the vikings and the Ragnarson clan as accurately depicted with all their villainous brutality, but that would mean making Christians look like the good guys and I suppose that's more intolerable to Ubisoft than completely butchering the authenticity of the vikings. I could go into more and more about the complete lack of accuracy depicted in the social attitudes and society, but that is just nitpicking and doesn't really matter so long as they get the core of it right and they did not - it's as if you was playing GTA but was not allowed to steal a car.AC Valhalla tortures the player to a unique degree compared to its Origins and Odyssey counterparts. Sure, Origins and Odyssey has a ton of things to explore and collect, but AC Valhalla seems to have this ten fold and, what's more, hides everything behind awkward architecture and minor puzzles with zero regard for how it makes any logical sense. If, like me, you want to collect everything on the map then be prepared not for a fun experience, but for a test of endurance, because virtually everything will be locked behind an explosive wall, a small crack, a locked door, a barred door - you will spend as much time figuring out how to get to an object as you will collecting objects and this is not a good thing, it's frustrating and I mean it when I say it is a real test of endurance. The map is simply not designed with any kind of logic, things are hidden and locked away with no regard for design consistency or reasonable player expectation. As an example: There is a location in the game called Evinghou Tower and it contains an ingot to collect.  The ingot is on an enemy inside a room in the tower that has no entrance, so how do you get in? Well, you must destroy some wooden panels on a window behind the tower - see how this makes no sense? There is an enemy in there, so we assume that there must be a way in and you will spend all your time looking for some hole or door, after all, the enemy got in there somehow and it is logical to assume he got in there via a door or some hole in the ruin wall, but nope, there is no logical consistency; you will have to deal with dozens of such cases like this - oh and some areas have loot that can only be accessed once you progress far enough into the game so Ubisoft doesn't spawn that loot until you reach that point...right? Nope, enjoy spending many hours wasting your time trying to find that secret entrance only to give up and later realise you could only enter once you reached that point in the questline.As for other concerns - this is the buggiest AC since the release of Unity. I played Odyssey and Origins without a single crash or bugged quest. So far I have had one quest bug and probably a dozen or so crashes. It seems the game has about a 50/50 chance of crashing if you try to take a steam screenshot and will often just crash during a cutscene. I also get weird stuttering in towns despite the fact I am running this game on a RTX 3070, 32GB of RAM and Ryzen 9 3900x 12 Core CPU. All I can say is that I am glad I got this game while it was on sale.",negative

Assassin's Creed Valhalla,"This game is basically ""follow me to this location just so I can give you dialogue that you wont listen to"" about 1000 times. The entire game consists of you completing a dozen or so side stories that you will not care about just because most of them have nothing to do with vikings or your clan at all, just you. Sure this is fun for the first few hours but by the end of the game, I found myself skipping all cutscenes just to get it over with. This game is not worth 60 dollars. If you want to play it, wait for a sale or else you will be kicking yourself for wasting your money.",negative
Assassin's Creed Valhalla,"This is the most flawed Assassin's Creed game to date. I have played all main entries up to this point, and I must say this game is a disappointment. I cannot say it is a bad game, but between very frequent crashing on a very good PC (5900x/4070 Ti/32GB RAM), the game having microtransactions, all the gameplay issues and its size I simply cannot recommend it.It took me almost 200 hours to fully play through the entire game, including all the side content and clearing all the maps. The game is simply too long and nowhere near interesting (at least to me) to justify this length. It is a problem carried over from Assassin's Creed Odyssey, but at least Odyssey was more interesting and fun.There are a plethora of minor issues with the gameplay such as:* Character just not responding to inputs, most notably jumping during parkour* Bow aiming being wonky* ""hide and seek"" exploration, where collectibles or keys are hidden underground, or behind a wall* Unskippable long finisher animations* Parkour and combat are slow* No hold to sprint option* Max FPS lock is only 90* No way to disable anti-aliasing, so game ends up looking blurry. Resolution scale of 160% helped, but obviously affects performance.* One boss (Lost Wolf) was unkillable until I set my FPS lock to 60.* Sometimes characters referred to my male character as ""she"".* There are armor and weapon perks that deal AOE damage that kill civilians, which is a game over scenario.* Because upgrade materials are so scarce, it is practically impossible to try out new armor sets without huge amount of grinding.* Inventory management UI is atrocious, especially the armor runes screen and quest item inventory.* No horse galloping in cities, and what constitutes ""in city"" is very inconsistentBecause these issues are stretched over 200 hours, they are amplified a lot and result in a lot infuriating moments.The first hour or two, the introduction, are shocking. It is so far removed from anything Assassin's Creed and so boring compared to all previous entries. The story is what I like the series for. They always managed to make it at least remotely interesting. Not this time. In the 200 hours of the game, there are at best 5 hours of interesting content. The map is splitinto zones, and majority of the main campaign is doing repetitive missions in each zone. Most of the zone stories do not actually progress the main story at all, and there is no guidance to which ones will. The ending was also pretty strange, and I have no idea how they are gonna make this make sense in AC Mirage.The item progression is also changed from previous game in a weird way. Not only they give you max rarity items very early in the game in the stupid digital deluxe edition which is included in the complete edition, you get no gear drops in the game besides exploration, which is not everyone's cup of tea. My character ended up looking exactly the same for the entire game as there was no reason to switch armors, since my current set given to me from the start had a decent set bonus, and the game is extremely stingy with armor upgrade materials. The items also have a bunch of weird stats that are poorly explained. All the cool looking stuff is also in the shop, so the microtransactions most definitely affected this part of the game.Pretty much all side content/side quests from previous games is replaced by ""random world events"" and collectibles that are largely meaningless and there are hundreds of them. It is very shallow. A lot of exploration is tedious due to how many things there are, and how many of them are hidden. Playing hide and seek with hidden keys, explosive barrels and doors is just not fun for 200 hours.Stealth feels like an afterthought in this game. It is super inconsistent, sometimes enemies don't see you with direct line of sight, sometimes they see you while you are in bushes that should make you invisible to enemies or very far away. Sometimes when you are in stealth, enemies will react with voice lines when you enter an indoors area even though nobody saw you enter. Sometimes they will turn around when you ""stealthily"" assassinate someone behind. You cannot assassinate fully unaware enemies if you are in combat or are being pursued but not directly in combat, the prompt simply won't appear.Of the good I can point out that the graphics, specifically lighting and shadows can look really good in certain weather conditions. Dynamic weather is cool. The music is alright.",negative
Assassin's Creed Valhalla,"I had planned to surpass Steam's word limit and craft an extremely long review outlining every issue with AC Valhalla, detailing point by point why each aspect of the game is problematic, and why you shouldn't even consider wasting your time on it.But frankly, it's not worth it. Writing critically about Valhalla requires an effort that exceeds the game's own ambitions. It would be disproportionate.In other words: Here's a mediocre and lazy review, fitting for the experience offered.Assassinâs Creed Valhalla is not a bad game, nor is it a good one.It is painfully mediocre.A vast amount of brainless content without polish. The most literal and fearsome definition of ""quantity over quality.""From top to bottom, the game offers a beautiful and detailed open world (as always), explored almost linearly due to poorly made artificial barriers (Something Origins and Odyssey players are already accustomed to), riddled with a huge amount of recycled, repetitive, and generic content.You would think that after so much time making the same game and recycling concepts, never innovating on their own or building upon their successes, Ubisoft would at least meet established standards by previous titles in the same franchise, but no...It's not enough for each hour of the game to be more tepid and forgettable than the last.It's not enough for the writing, although not offensively bad, to lack any sense of dramatic conflict or intriguing narrative structure or thematic coherence or ANY traces of something for the brain to chew on.It's not enough that the narrative lacks even a hint of cinematography in its presentation, framing almost every dialogue, scene, and interaction in the most banal and impactless way possible.It's not enough that the combat is nothing more than functional, so shallow that it stagnates in the first hours of the game and ultimately breaks completely (forcing you to increase the difficulty to the maximum in the hope of some sense of challenge), even after all the additions of weapons, abilities, and different enemies.For the love of Odin, THIS IS THE SAME STUDIO THAT MADE FOR HONOR!It's not enough for the few memorable moments that organically arise during the game to be completely ruined by inconsistent balancing, placing enemies in your way with levels up to FIVE TIMES higher than the maximum level of the region you are exploring.It's not enough that everything you find in the world, every activity you do, every puzzle you solve, has received such a minimal degree of care that the intern's joke applies perfectly to almost all the game's content.It's not enough that the narrative and main mission designs are so bad that they hardly differ from the side content.It's not enough that they use a setting like this to say nothing (as usual) about anything. It's not enough to present a rich historical setting as just an action theme park, without nuances, texture and a healthy dose of genuine cruelty and rawness.Too anachronistic, too romanticized, unconvincing, and devoid of deeper characterization to accompany all the hard work of the art team.Without ethnic conflicts or cultural clashes, without strange cosmological views or adverse moralities, making every plot point and character seem inconsequential, boring and too contemporary...You might even see some of your allies boasting about killing like it was an adventure, but you won't learn anything about the northlanders in this game.And you won't see your crew trying to crucify a priest just for the fun of it.And you'll still get the desynchronization message every time you kill an innocent peasant, on purpose or not, even if you just burned his house and brutally slaughtered more than two dozen soldiers.None of this is enough; the basics, what they've been doing for over a decade, seems to have gotten worse. Stealth, graphics, ""parkour"", combat, exploration and progression, stories. Less polished. Less finished. Simplified in many ways. Bloated and mediocre. It's still a franchise trying to do everything at once and not doing anything right.Except for the accessibility options, every aspect of the game seems to have received a downgrade or remained exactly the same. There is no refinement and iteration. They are simply making the same game, telling increasingly worse stories without achieving any obvious improvements.And now they've decided to increase the size and decrease the quality?!This shouldn't happen with games made by such large studios. Such expensive games.If you're like me, having played decades of open-world games and having a predisposition to squeeze the most content out of the games you play, you looked in horror when you realized that the main AAA single-player experiences of the 8th generation would be dominated by soulless and increasingly larger open-world games, infested with disposable content and checklist grinds.Nowadays, I tend to approach these games differently. I no longer try to do everything or most of the content the game offers me. I don't try to complete lists, but rather what I find on my own or what catches my attention.And even ignoring a good portion of the more shallow content the game had to offer (about half), what I saw and played was not enough to sustain the experience. And there were hardly any memorable moments. Inside or outside the main story.The most elaborate activity is the viking raids (equivalent to camps). And what a glorious sight it was to see my group of warriors running toward a monastery to the sound of battle chants, killing and setting everything on fire along the way while the artificial intelligence of enemies and peasants always imploded, completely breaking my immersion. It was always funny to see people forgetting that I had just destroyed their village five seconds ago.The biggest surprise I had was enduring for so long until I realized that from then on, there would be nothing but more of the same, as the last 30 hours of the game were practically identical, and the quality from moment to moment didn't go beyond average. And there were still 30 or 50 more hours for me to finish.I only endured because it's such an unoffensive game that leaves such a neutral impression that I was playing on autopilot. I didn't get burned out or bored. I just decided to stop because I saw that it wouldn't be worth continuing.I didn't care about any event or character and as a viking fantasy, the game is a complete failure.Even the stupid pseudo-philosophical dichotomy that forms the basis of the franchise was implemented in the laziest way possible. It's almost an inside joke at this point.AC VALHALLA is exactly what you'd expect: A culmination of the worst design trends of the last generation. No original ideas. Mediocre execution and a world of wasted potential. A game overflowing with content, but that does very little for your time.A colossal monument devoted to cheap entertainment. A waste.P.S.1: Play Expeditions: Vikings or the Banner Saga Trilogy instead of this.P.S.2: Johnni Langer is a great author for you to read some historical material about Vikings. Highly recommended.",negative

Assassin's Creed Valhalla,"Sweet little lies. Everything the Steam description tells you is wrong or half truths.- Choices hardly matter and the story is linear and will end the same way with very little inconsequential variation. As for advanced RPG mechanics, Final Fantasy games on Playstation had more advanced RPG mechanics. Competence points means nearly nothing given how inconsequential most of the competence tree's bonus are (+0.5% attack, hell yeah !), and the most important moves you'll find in random chests while exploring, meaning you can completely miss them.- The combat is the same very basic dodge based combat that was featured in the previous AC game. Sure the moves are good looking (but not any sort of realistic) and the executions are viceral, but the same three will play on repeat until you can't stand them anymore and wish you can pass these way too long down times. And stealth may as well not exist given how bland it is and how terrible the enemy AI, being incredibly blind with a very narrow FOV, but the second you enter it, they will spot you in a couple seconds, leaving you no chance to fix your mistake or even understand it.- The open world is just a boring blend of open fields and forests with oversized roman ruins here and there. It's massive and massively empty and repetitive. And since it's set in the medieval time, everyone and everything human is grey/brown and dirty, and the second you enter a city, all the colours vanish. As for their so called ""viking way of life"" they offer you to experience, there is nothing historical about it. What you'll experience is the ""viking way of life"" instagram americans with 0.2% danish DNA praise. Commerce that made the wealth of nordic people ? Inexistant. Rich writing, singing and poem crafting ? Reduced to a stupid minigame about dissing random people in the streets. Religion ? Cliche reash of the Poetic Edda with zero thought for the other important myths. Cloth, arms, armor... ? Fantasy garbage. Raids and combat ? You're soloing whole armies while your viking buddies can't handle one archer, only for you to plunder crates. No riches or anything of the sort in monasteries, just crates. And naval combat isn't a thing, which is utterly idiotic for a people which strength was based on its naval prowess.- You have zero say in how you build your settlement. You can't place the various buildings yourself, just choose which to build, and the customization is just choosing where to put a couple statues and what the big tree in the middle should look like. And a personnal grip of mine, said settlement ends up being a dainty little village, a little haven in the forest. You know, the exact thing you'd expect an invading's people forward operating base would be. No walls, no security, just people enjoying their time and surviving on a single farm raising two goats and a cow.Summed up, if you want to spend hours doing the three same things, this game is for you. If you care about history, nordic culture or having fun, this game isn't for you.",negative
Assassin's Creed Valhalla,"Combat is clunky and bad, weapons do very inconsistent damage, and many choices make no sense. Upgrades have barely any impact, and the skill tree is massive, with each investment doing essentially nothing (and in testing, in many cases, literally nothing.) Story is very poorly written, with very obvious ""twists"" you see coming hours prior, and the main quests are essentially all the same. Even dialogue is written poorly. MC is supposed to have poetic tendencies, yet the poems are cringy and bad, similar to what a 12 year old emo kid would write back in 2002. Movement is similarly clunky, to give a feeling of momentum, but it really just feels....bad. Like the MC is fat as hell. Inputs are sluggish in response, and since every single enemy has frame-perfect input reading, that becomes an issue quickly. Acquired abilities do nothing to assist in combat, and often don't work or miss, sometimes actually just passing through an enemy's hitbox without making contact because the game just flat out doesn't work right. And the open world is big, but very, very empty. There are small events in the world, but they all are poorly written and cringe inducing, on top of being boring, and badly voice acted. Ubisoft went for comedy, without knowing how to write it. I had heard this game was the best AC in ages, but really it's no better than any other, cheap, quick, and bad, with a veneer of viking to play into current popular trends. I'd skip it, since it's a total, and deliberate, waste of your time. Maybe if Ubsoft offered it for free, and vowed to never make another game again, I'd actually play it for all of our benefits, but yeah, no. This game has nothing to recommend it.",negative

Assassin's Creed Valhalla,"Overall, a downgrade from AC Odyssey by quite a margin.1. The Main character is so much more bland, boring and forgettable than in Odyssey. Eivor just kinda exists, all the while being the most hypocritical character ever: wants peace and quiet - invades someone's land and is mad when they're angry and defend themselves. wtf is this ''Gentleman Viking'' bs?!? Vikings were morally reprehensible, and yet here we are glorifying their atrocities.2. Where's the depth???? Characters mostly seem bland and single issue motivated. Lines are meh at best. Sidequests are insanely short and meaningless when compared to Odyssey. The shallowness of the entire game is insulting, to be entirely honest.3. Choices: So far, choices seem meaningless. In 80% of cases, you're given three options, you pick one and get all three anyways. In about 20% of cases you're given a real choice to make, and even these seem superficial and meaningless, with only a small percentage seeming to have an effect. If not, the time delay to feel the consequences is so long that you'll have forgotten entirely about the story arc by the time they show up.4. Builds: There's barely any variety in Valhalla, and whichever build you opt for feels more or less like any other. Upgrading gear is an incredible chore which really just pushes you to pick one and stick with it for the entire game.5. Movement: Eivor feels like an anvil being coaxed into movement, whereas Alexios/Kassandra feel light and agile, both in and out of combat.6. Emotions: Valhalla tries to be ''serious'' and 'dark' all of the time. This means that character deaths just don't have the same impact as in Odyssey. There is little to no contrast between the happy times and the sad times that they all mesh into a sort of unhappy middle7. Graphics in Valhalla feel like a noted regression from Odyssey. I play Odyssey on med-high and was generally impressed. I played Valhalla on Ultra (at the cost of frames) and was still thoroughly disappointed8. Music: Valhalla's music is alright, if a bit uninspired. The ''Shanties'' are utter bear excrements. They do not come from your crew, but a voice in your head just singing, as though someone put headphones on Eivor. The shanties stop as soon as you leave command or try and use a bow (which is immersion breaking as all hell) which was not the case in Odyssey. And the lyrics are.... let's just say LazyTown had better creative direction.9. Sidequests: Odyssey's quests were fleshed out, with funny or interesting characters, and more often than not an unexpected ending. Valhalla's ''world events'' on the other hand are incredibly simplistic, rarely take you more than 50m from the quest giver and as a result are incredibly forgettable. No love or effort put into them, and it shows.10. Settlements: Every settlement i've encountered in Valhalla seemed tiny and dead. Discovering Lunden was incredibly disappointing compared to arriving at Athens. As a whole, Valhalla felt smaller and deader than Odyssey. Valhalla has more maps, but they all feel significantly worse than any of the maps from Odyssey11. The maps: idk if it was on purpose, but Valhalla maps are an absolute pain in the posterior to traverse. England seems to be entirely made up of narrow valleys and towering hills with sheer rock cliff faces between them, making any straight line voyage unbearably long, in narrow, claustrophobic spaces. Asgard is even worse being entirely vertical, which led me to rage quit a few times (go down there, then go back up, then go back down over and over and over). Sightlines are generally bad, even from the top of hills everything is foggy.Valhalla's maps are somewhere between disastrous and passable.Overall Valhalla is a serious downgrade from Odyssey, in just about every way imaginable.It's a bad AC and an even worse Open World ''RPG''. Just play Odyssey instead.",negative
Assassin's Creed Valhalla,"It's just an incredibly boring and stale slog fest. The game is quite pretty but overall very brainless and monotone in execution. If you are the type of person legit looking for eye candy without having to think and just grind the same activities over and over this is a gem for you. If you are seeking any sort of substance, avoid this game.",negative
Assassin's Creed Valhalla,"I don't really think of myself as someone who is picky about game audio, as I've never played a game where I found that aspect to be a problem, but within the first 30 minutes of playing this game I honestly thought my ears were clogged. All of the sounds in this game, voices, sound effects, etc. sound way too compressed and like I'm playing while using the free earbuds they hand out on airplanes. I tried to play through it since Ubisoft has announced that they don't plan on fixing this issue but I can't. The rest of the game seems fine but the low-quality audio really messes with immersion.",negative
Assassin's Creed Valhalla,"This game is exactly what is wrong with open worlds these days. A big vast world of emptiness and boredom! Instead of adding actual content and meaning to the game to make it longer, they force you to spend hours traveling in the world, challengelessly and with no fun, to start a mission.Then you start a mission, it's a long cut-scene of ugly animations that reminds you of 2001. Then the cut-scene is over, you have to follow one dude for another 5 minutes just to listen to a stupid pointless conversation! Don't get me wrong, I love stories in games, by checking my games library you can see how much I love games with a good story. But this game is nothing but a time thief!Then there is the skill tree ...! It's soooo f*cking big with so many useless crap inside it! WHAT IS THE POINT?! They want you to feel like there is such a big sea of options in front of you, but it's nothing but an illusion! Nothing but another waste of time to just see what skills are there to unlock! One of the most fun activities in games for me is checking the skills, comparing them and deciding which path matches my playstyle and go for them. But that means nothing in this game! Tens of skill nodes that you would never bother reading through, let alone comparing and deciding about!After 6 hours of playing, I barely had any fun, I've just been running around and talking with people and watching ugly animations in cut-scenes. By the end, all these useless elements of time wasting made me uninstall the game and decide against ever playing it.I'm glad at least I bought it on a sale ...",negative

Assassin's Creed Valhalla,"So, I can confidently say that Assassin's Creed Valhalla itâs one of the most frustrating gaming experiences Iâve ever had. Ubisoft has taken a franchise that used to be about precision, and clever game mechanics and stretched it into a bloated, corporate cash grab.The biggest problem with AC Valhalla is how incredibly boring the missions are. The game feels like it was designed to waste your time. Fetch quests, uninspired objectives, and endless grinding drag the experience into a slog. The story missions are just as bad, sure, thereâs a plot somewhere in there, but the pacing is horrible. It feels like they made everything as long as possible just to inflate the gameâs playtime. Quality ? Gone. Immersion ? Also gone. Youâre left doing the same things over and over again, wondering if thereâs any payoff ( there isnât ).The story in Assassinâs Creed Valhalla is solid and engaging in concept. It follows Eivor, a Viking warrior, as they lead their clan to settle in England, forge alliances, and take on powerful enemies. The plot has moments of intrigue and emotion, and Eivorâs character is fleshed out well enough to keep you invested.However, the pacing of the story suffers due to the repetitive mission design. While the narrative itself is decent, it gets bogged down by the endless grind and lackluster objectives you have to complete to move it forward. The result is a story that feels stretched too thin, which makes it hard to fully appreciate the parts that are genuinely interesting.Thereâs nothing much to say about the graphics and details. (look great) :)And now the biggest sh*t from Ubisoft: Microtransactions in a single-player game :/The fact that you have to spend real money to get cool gear, cosmetics, or boosts is absolutely disgusting. Itâs an insult to us (players) who have already paid for the game. Thereâs no reason these items couldnât have been earnable through in-game grinding. But Ubisoft doesnât want you to earn them, they want you to pay for them. This isnât a free to play mobile game, this is a 60 euros AAA title, and theyâre still milking us for every cent.Whatâs worse is how Ubisoft has designed the game to encourage spending. Want to get powerful weapons or gear faster ? youâll either need to grind for hours upon hours doing the same boring activities or just open your wallet. Itâs manipulative and anti-consumer, and I refuse to support this kind of business model.Assassin's Creed Valhalla is the breaking point for me when it comes to Ubisoft. ( This is the last AC game I bought on Steam ); Theyâve become one of the most anti-consumer company in gaming. Every decision they make seems focused on squeezing more money out of players while delivering less and less actual quality. Assassinâs Creed Series used to be a franchise that I loved, but now itâs just a shell of its former self.Between the bloated mission design and egregious microtransactions, I cannot recommend Valhalla to anyone. ( DON'T MAKE ME START WITH DENUVO, BIG NO ), If youâre considering buying this game, do so only at a much lower discount, or donât at all. Save your money and support developers who respect their players instead of treating them like cash cows.As for me, Iâm done with Ubisoft. I wonât be buying another one of their games until they completely overhaul how they treat their customers. Donât reward their bad behavior. Let them know that this kind of anti-consumer garbage isnât okay.Unfortunately, 4/10.",negative
Assassin's Creed Valhalla,"After about 145h (most of them from before the game was released on Steam), I have, at long last, completed the main campaign, story DLC, and epilogue. And so only one question remains: Is Valhalla a good Assassinâs Creed game?Well, no. It is fundamentally not an Assassinâs Creed game â Valhalla is about AC as much as, say, Skyrim is about racism. Yes, it has some of that, no, it isnât what the game is about. Eivor, the protagonist, vehemently refuses to join the Assassins for the entirety of the game though they still hunt down the proto-Templars (aka the Order of the Ancients) because â¦ Hytham asked nicely? Well, I guess, why not.That is not to say Ubi didnât *try* to make it an AC game. There are plenty of nods and references, scenery reminiscent of the Ezio trilogy and AC III (Tombs of the Fallen!), and they brought back familiar faces in the modern day segment â sort of. You see, there is a character called âShaunâ who looks deceptively like a character of the same name from earlier AC games and even has the same VA, but where Shaun used to be a hilarious snarky â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ (and my favourite character), this weird new clone is just kinda there to be friendly and helpful and utterly devoid of personality. Thanks, I hate it.The only thing that astonished me about the game was how perfectly bland it is. I wouldnât say the story is bad, necessarily â except for the various endings, those were pretty awful â but it also isnât memorable by any stretch of the imagination. Many reviewers before me have lamented the pointless, bloated, meandering quest lines about conquering England so it suffices to say here that I agree wholeheartedly. It was a boring slog and the payoff was minimal. As the protagonist, Eivor had their moments - I certainly enjoyed them always being the voice of reason - but ultimately there was no growth whatsoever and the character remained as bland as the rest of the game.The gameplay loop gets tired fast. Because stealth feels off â enemies are either complete morons or they can spot you from across the camp with no line of sight â I mostly murdered my way through the game in melee combat, mashing buttons. I figured since I am not playing an assassin anyway there was no point in bothering with frustrating stealth mechanics - not to mention that it would also be completely out of character for Eivor who very clearly said they consider stealth cowardly. Why are they the protagonist in an AC game again? Anyway, after a couple of hours, you have seen all the finisher animations in combat which then just become boring to watch over and over again. I was not a fan of AC Odyssey, but I have to say its stealth and combat were definitely better than Valhallaâs.The gameâs redeeming factor is its visual quality. Itâs just straight-up gorgeous and a big part of why I finished it is because I wanted to see new, pretty environments. On my (fairly high-end) system, the game ran like a dream at solid 60FPS â at least until the next crash because, oh boy, this game is extremely unstable. It crashes all the time. This happens in addition to a colourful assortment of minor and major bugs which, two years after release, are still commonplace. In a full-price game with a ludicrously expensive ingame MTX shop. That takes balls, Ubi.The DLC were more of the same for the most part. Wrath of the Druids resembled the main campaign in how completely forgettable it was while Siege of Paris at least made an effort to be a bit more cinematic. I absolutely loved Paris and exploring the sewers underground, it was the first time I felt like I was playing an AC game. The focus on assassination missions helped though again it seemed completely out of character for Eivor. Nevertheless, I wore Basimâs robes for the entire DLC and pretended I was there to solve a difficult situation as an assassin. Putting the ârole-playingâ into RPG and all that. SoP was definitely diminished by a completely pointless ârebel missionâ system which was neither tied into the DLC main quest nor became otherwise relevant at any point in the DLC. They didnât even try to conceal the fact that it was added as busywork to stretch the playtime.In conclusion, AC Valhalla â just like AC Odyssey â cannot possibly be called an Assassinâs Creed game. As a Norse vikingr RPG, it was alright and if you like riding through pretty scenery while casually checking off forgettable missions, side quests, and various collectables without any challenging gameplay or complex stories, then you may well enjoy this game. I definitely enjoyed AC Valhalla sometimes, for an hour here or there. Overall, it was still a massive waste of my time and I hope the trend of bloated-games-unrelated-to-AC is over with this pointless entry into the series.",negative
Assassin's Creed Valhalla,"Assassin's Creed Valhalla is a disappointment compared to its predecessors. The game feels like a step backward in several key areas.Repetitive Gameplay: The missions quickly become monotonous, with little variety or innovation. It feels like you're doing the same tasks over and over again.Technical Issues: The game is plagued with bugs and glitches that disrupt the experience. From characters getting stuck in the environment to crashes, it's frustrating to deal with these issues.Weak Storyline: The narrative lacks depth and fails to engage. The characters are forgettable, and the plot feels disjointed and uninspired.Voice Acting and Music: The voice acting and music have taken a noticeable step back compared to previous games in the series. The performances lack the emotional depth and impact that made earlier titles memorable.Combat System: The combat mechanics are clunky and lack the fluidity seen in previous titles. It often feels unresponsive and frustrating.Graphics: While the game looks good, it doesn't stand out compared to other recent releases.4/10",negative
Assassin's Creed Valhalla,"Felt like a really boring chore, the Alliance mechanic was interesting with the first 3 settlements than when i had to do the same thing over 50 times it got so boring, the game had boring and uninteresting side characters, overall i am giving a 3/10 to this game, i can't recommend it. Choices don't have any impact just like AC Odyssey. The map is massive but it get's boring very quickly to explore it when you can't interact with the world at all. Not even worth getting this game on sale to be honest, which i did. Do not play this game, you are going to waste your time, just like i did. It had some good moments which were far in between, but it's just not worth because of all of the boring and repetitive garbage. + I beat all of the DLC's as well and they were boring too.

No steam achievements, no purchase.This review was made during the free weekend so as of tomorrow, the game will leave my account and never will return unless they change their mind and add steam achievements that consoles and uplay already have.Ubisoft would rather have staff spend time moderating the steam forum to delete or move people's posts about wanting steam achievement, which will never end, instead of spending a fraction of that time just implementing the steam achievements.

Assassin's Creed Valhalla,"I don't really understand where is Ubisoft going with the AC franchise. This serie's charm was all based in its tactical, linear, and strategic aspect. Back when Ezio used to be hopping from a roof to the other, in between balconies just to avoid the lethal enemies and eliminate the chosen one. Hell even after the assassination we used to get a badass scene.I understand after years they wanted to change the formula a bit, out of a fear of leaning into the repetition and it was usually a hit or miss, where AC odyssey and Black flag were the rare ones where praises outweighed the critics.But coming to Valhalla, i don't recognize anything from the franchise. I'm 45 hours in and i feel I'm still scratching the surface with almost all of the ""order"" intact. I'm fighting wars, claiming territories and alliances, grinding my ass for materials to upgrade the base, ect ...And in between the chores, you get transported to somewhere new where you start a whole new cycle of missions where you also get interrupted to jump into a whole other instance ... honestly I'm lostI don't even understand the story of ""Eivor"" neither his motives besides following his brother's journey of illegal immigration. Perhaps i will get a clearer view after 80 hours of play time, but I'm already getting bored of doing the same missions again and again, where most of the time is spent in travel time ( yes, forget teleporting because the devs wants to actually fill your time getting from A to B)The combat is a bit clunky unlike all the previous ones that shined on that part, the parkour is annoying, the grind for armor is extremely tedious... and to top it off, the game crashes every session. So much, that i forgot the last time that i had to actually go to the menu and press the ""exit to desktop"".Graphics and visuals were good, unfortunately not enough to make me turn a blind eye on all these debacles.Honestly if they called the game ""Valhalla"" only i would've recommended it, but this is nothing like an Assassin's creed game.",negative

Assassin's Creed Valhalla,"A Game That Disrespects Your TimeI really wanted to love AC Valhalla but after investing a considerable amount of time, I can confidently say that this game is a huge disappointment. It's not worth the time and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. If you are curious about the plot just watch a 10 minute yt summarizing what happens itâs all you need to know.As a fan of the AC series especially AC1, 2, Brotherhood, Revelations, Black Flag, Unity, and Odyssey. Odyssey was a game that despite not feeling like a traditional AC title have an amazing RPG elements, replayability and incredible experience. But Valhalla? It's nothing like that.The game has a ton of content plenty of dialogue (thankfully skippable) lots of grind, and countless side activities. But despite all the content it feels pointless and empty. There is no real reward for your efforts making the entire experience feel like a waste of time.For example, the grind in this game is just infuriating. You can grind materials to upgrade your village but the rewards are almost nonexistent. You can spend hours gathering resources only to get minimal payoff. And that is just one example of how the game drains your time without offering meaningful rewards. You would think after all that grind you would get a sense of progress but nope itâs just more repetitive â¥â¥â¥â¥.Armor sets, weapons, and the skill tree are a huge letdown. In Odyssey you get that exhilarating feeling when you got your armor set, weapon but in Valhalla there is none of that. The armor sets here donât feel impactful and the skill tree is a major downgrade. The skills are bland and lack the creativity that Odyssey had.As for the story... it could have been great but it's buried under a mountain of tedious sidequests that offer zero impact on the main narrative. If youwant to get the TRUE ending like the one where you would say 'Okay, that makes sense.' you will have to slog through most of the sidequests which are incredibly forgettable. Had they trimmed down the filler the story would have flowed much better but the way they designed it only serves to waste your time.The gameplay? S L O W , clunky and frustrating. The combat feels repetitive and the stealth mechanics are laughable. The new cape mechanic feels pointless and is just another missed opportunity to make the game feel fresh. The game never seems to pick up pace and I found myself getting more and more irritated as I played like WTF is this. I have never been so pissed off by a single-player game in the last few years like I am with this one. Like the movement through the entrance and exit of a rock cave in the game, or riding your horse, or climbing they made it ssssslllloooooow, insanely slow. You know why? BECAUSE THE DONT GIVE A â¥â¥â¥â¥ ABOUT YOUR TIMEIn conclusion, I really wanted to love AC Valhalla. Itâs a beautiful game and they clearly put a lot of effort into it but it simply doesnât deliver. Itâs not rewarding and the time investment isnât worth it. If youâre a fan of AC Iâd suggest skipping this one. SAVE YOURSELF! RUN FOOL!",negative
Assassin's Creed Valhalla,"Not recommended, but if you see this as -80%/-90% and you're uhhh, really into AC lore or really liked the previous ""RPG trilogy"" titles, go ahead. Warning: It's Mid. But almost all bugs are fixed, thanks console beta testers!But, why is it mid? Because even if you take the ""oh it's not REAL assassin's creed! it's just some rpg!"" out of equation not only the game falls short in comparsion to, in my opinion, the previous title; AC:Odyssey, but it also it's a really bad game for all the reasons that could be pointed out to any other game. I'll point out every single one i find an issue with:- Really weak writing - The story of the ingame character which is basically 95% of the games story is really really weak, it feels forced, every single story point feels forced and happens as an excuse for you to go to location x to do y to progress the story to change the stabbed dagger into a raven figurine so you are allowed to go to location z, culminating at the point where you find the <lore relevant location> the present day animus crew is actually looking for to progress the story of assassin's creed. A shame the characters don't start cheering after they're done with that animus journey. Then again outside of brief chats in ""The Truth"" equivalent exploration events you don't interact with them at all so i guess them pulling you out counts. The story also has a lot of forced in ""your choices matter!"" scenarios but they're all the same thing: Investigate 1-3 people and decide who's the traitor(this trope is literally the plot of 3 arcs). Because if you do choices correctly you get *drum roll* the not traitor dude as background character during whopping 20(dlc not included) raids if you bother to put them in. Do note that bad writing doesn't follow into the actual universe lore relevant part of the story, i guess it's done by a senior writer that thought up the whole lore around 2012.- really WEIRD writing - This deserves a whole point because someone needs to tell me why. Why are writers overusing words ""consume"", ""devour"", ""crave"" in the script so much. Hell, the game slaps you with ""Consume ration"" before the bad writers can do their thing. There are many other words you can use instead. The use of them feels really forced into the script and someone needs to tell me why everybody started to do the same for their niche video essay scripts.- repetitivity overdrive - Everything in this game feels repetitive. From the overused copypaste explore locations(i know this house, it's the house with the random basement staircase!) to the story(3 ""find the traitor"" arcs). The only saving grace be the new locations with some unique landmarks that don't repeat. But what you do there is still the same.- your choices don't matter - None of the choices actually matter, the story will railroad you even if you choose the not traitor as traitor. Even the (character story) ending despite there being the ""True"" and ""Bad"" endings the only difference is uhh you'll maybe feel bad if you got the bad ending and if you got the true ending you get to keep the guy that was absent from 75% of the story anyway. And as for the other choices it's uhh who dies during the ending and who gets to be your raid helper.- literally too many things in the game - I actually haven't finished the game, still got like 3 dlc and some special ending added right before steam release(thanks again console beta testers!) to do. But i won't be doing them for some time, due to to how much i had to go through to get to the normal ending. I'm done, i wanna play something else. That shouldn't be what i should feel for the last 5-10h of gameplay. But because there's so much bloat i don't wanna continue.- ancient ones mechanic is a massive downgrade compared to previous game - it was really cool in the previous game but this is so bad i can't even, It's progression is forced by main story, you can't finish it until finishing main story, the conclusion is terrible, there's only like 6 targets you ACTUALLY need to find through investigation then another 4 ""branch leader"" dudes you find out about after doing the branches for which EVERY branch is main story locked so killing these 4 dudes feels like a chore more than a reward. and they did it so you can't randomly find ancient ones by accident i think.The ""actual game gamey"" part of the review:Combat - same as for any other ac game, really. though some enemies can throw you around and â¥â¥â¥â¥ so that's kinda cool.Stealth - optionalGraphics - hold up to the current era, has more detail than ac odyssey(though you can't really do much detail on marble can you)Optimization - my 2019 pc can run the game without choking to death, so that's way better than the current standard, big +Estimated play time: 100h(100% base game)-170h(100% all dlc) excluding cosmetic and purposely repetitive game modes.Well, is there anything good in the game? Honestly? Yeah, but it's not even their idea to begin with. One DLC literally adds Hades(the rouge-like video game) as a playable game mode. Obviously it uses the 3d world and utilizes the norse mythology instead of greek. But other than that it's almost the same thing. And damn, the mini story of THAT DLC is way better than whole main story. And you get access to the DLC after getting to the main part of the game so it teaches you combat. Ima be honest that DLC is probably the reason one can put up with the game and call it mid instead of bad.Go buy and play 3 anime jrpgs instead tbh",negative

Assassin's Creed Valhalla,"TL;DR: Give this a really hard pass unless you find it under $20 and really want it.Technical SideThis game is a technical disaster. Nothing in this game really works as intended (like any other Ubisoft title)- Constantly crashes (I'm not kidding, after the intro you'll be lucky to play longer that 45 minutes at a time)- No Steam integration- Ubisoft's store integration is awful. If I see ""failed to synchronize"" one more time... I shouldn't need to download your garbage store to play a game on Steam. They need to get that through their thick, greedy skulls.- That stupid, 2 minute long intro video that you can't skip. Just delete the files in the folder if you buy this. There are guides on Steam for thisGameplayAll of your favorite, stale gameplay mechanics are here!- They make sure to show you every single microtransaction you can make before you even hit the ""Start"" button for the first time- How do they make difficult enemies? They just make them have more health and deal more damage- Boring back and forth quests: talk to person a, they tell you to talk to person b, and they tell you to go back and talk to person a again- Unmemorable NPCs- A massive open world dotted with meaningless locations- Boring, lazy story writing that really doesn't make sense. ""Hello, stranger. Of course I'll just join your murder cult with no explanation!""Final ThoughtsThis is a pathetic excuse of a game. Honestly, I was on the fence and I should have listened to my gut. This is the last Ubisoft game I buy: it's clear they don't care about their customers. I'd give this a really hard pass unless you can get it for under $20 or $15. This game is a joke and Ubisoft is a clown for thinking that this is an acceptable launch state of a AAA game.",negative

After searching around for help I found that you can work acting this by changing which version of Proton is used to launch the game. Using Proton 7.0-6 let me get past this (gear icon > Compatibility > Force the use of a specific Steam Play compatibility tool, select Proton 7.0-6 from the drop-down).Once I finally got in game, my system locked up a few seconds after the first cutscene ended. I moved the character, the screen went black, and I had to hold the power button for 10 seconds to reboot the Steam Deck. Same kind of lock up occurred again  later after about 10 minutes of gameplay. And again after about 20 minutes.

Assassin's Creed Valhalla,"4/10may our clans be forever bonded in friendship and love.. is a big bloody jokeâ³ this game is a bloated mess that absolutely doesn't value the players time or money. it's beautiful world is filled with repetitive tedium and very debatable plot that makes a mockery of it's viking setting; accompanied by gameplay structure that demands much but gives back so little and all of that is topped off with a pathetic excuse of ubisoft launcher integration that makes this piece of junk frequently crash to a point where it's hardly playable. also, let's not forget about greedy micro-transactions in a single player game and the disgusting steam integration that makes it look like nothing more than a quick cash grab from a financial struggling company... sincerely, axe up your bloody arse ubisoft. ac: valhalla is nothing more than unfinished and dull package that's made in the most lazy way possible. if someone wants to give a try to this garbage that pretends to be an assassin's creed title then please, go for a huge discount, it will be not worth it otherwise.this is how ubisoft crawls back to realistic current world and yet still being years behind what player wants and enjoy in gaming!Assassin's Creed: Valhalla| January 29, 2023 | [âââââ]",negative

Crashes all the time even with the beefy rig I have, way too huge of a world for NO REASON, and pointless story that I have so much disinterest in that I don't even really know what's going on. I used to jam with AC, but this is utter trash and so boring. Skip this one if you're an AC fan.",negative
Assassin's Creed Valhalla,"This is the first AC game that I just cannot bring myself to finish. I wouldn't consider myself a massive fan of the series, but as a historical geek I always tend to find myself buying them on sales and playing through them once. I've had numerous gripes with the series forever, but none strong enough to prevent me from playing the game until now.Maybe it's just that 3rd person action games have evolved so much in the last few years, but it is an understatement to say this game feels ""cheap"".Animations are floaty, bad, and feel budget. The sound design and mixing is so bad that I had to desperately search the settings and internet to find out why on earth everything sounded so bad (Turns out they decided to compress the audio like crazy to save space). The voice acting is boring and forgettable, the side quests are classic ubisoft trash with awful children voice actors that you just want to skip through.The combat is bad. It feels bad. Weapons lack any impact, it's far too floaty. Their idea of ""high difficulty"" is you die in 1-2 hits while enemies die in 10+ hits. For a game series that has continued to be hyper focused more on combat than stealth, completely failing at making the combat engaging is sad.Exploration sucks too. I turned on pathfinder mode originally as I liked these modes in Origins and Odyssey. All the environments are the same, white snowcovered mountains, with a light colored UI that makes it difficult to see areas to explore in the first place. The map UI is laggy and slow, the ability tree is full of garbage stat increases spread out in a convoluted way designed to look like a star constellation than be useful (Skyrim did it better). Your bird (Not every game needs to have a bird... classic Ubisoft copy and paste the same idea over and over again) is laggy and less useful than it was in previous games.Enemy AI is bad. Just everything about this game other than maybe the character models, texture maps, and actual graphics is just B tier at best. Shockingly bad game. I got it for like 8 dollars on sale and wish I had spent that on a double down instead.",negative

Assassin's Creed Valhalla,"AC Valhalla is a very broken game, and a very long game. I've put in 300+ hours according to Ubisoft's REQUIRED terrible launcher. Here's what matters.FINAL SCORE: 5/10. Individual scores below.Gameplay: 6/10. There are some fun moments to be had here, but they are marred by the incredible jank, particularly in combat. Plays sort of like darksouls, without good hitboxes. The controls are responsive enough, but by no means tight. It feels very floaty and ""hit with pool noodles"" for a lot of weapons. We won't get into the hilariously unfinished execution attacks or buggy enemies.Story: 3/10. Honestly, I dont play AC games for the story, but this one was particularly boring. I couldn't care less about it. Arrive in England, conquer England. The end. There's some tacked on Animus stuff, but at this point who cares? The developers clearly didn't.Dialogue: 2/10. There are some good moments, but holy hell. As a writer myself with a focus on dialogue, much of this was very painful. It essentially boils down to: What is happening right now? The characters say exactly that. Repeat. No nuance whatsoever, mostly pure pain with some rare gems. Good (or impressively terrible) voice acting can't do much for bad writing.Visuals: 9/10. It's very pretty. Many people care about graphics, but I am not one of them. I prefer a polished, fun game. That being said, even my old grumpy ass appreciated some of the stunning landscapes (particularly in Norway.)Open World: 6/10. Holy hell is this big. That's about it.  It's gigantic, but not particularly meaningful. But they went BIG.The Verdict: If you like a huge gigachad-sized map that's very pretty, with an absurd amount of barely meaningful collectibles, you'll like this. You'll need to get past the janky combat and impressively boring story and writing, though. The game might actually be better if you skip all dialogue and simply smash and loot.",negative

Assassin's Creed Valhalla,"After 60-odd hours I finally had to just give up on AC Valhalla. Main reason is straight-forward - I just didnt really care about the character(s), didnt care about Eivor in the sense that I wasn't compelled by the story that he was supposedly at the centre of. Compare with AC Origins and Odyssey - in both of those, Bayek and Kassandra/Alexios had deep, personal angst at stake, the death of a child in the former, and the loss of familly in the latter. What drives Eivor? - well, his father and mother were killed by the evil Kjotve, and by the end of the intro section in Norway Kjotve has been slain and Eivor`s family avenged.Then what happens? - Eivor and Sigurd head off to Dark Ages England to start a colony and spread out their influence, creating alliances and deploying political strategies (I mean, theres a bunch of battles etc along the way as well). And....that's pretty much it. Ravensthorpe has to be founded and upgraded and expanded, and the Viking influence must be extended. So basically this is Assassins Creed Settlers!Full disclosure - I have no interest in basebuilding or medieval strategy games. If that was what I wanted to play there`s an immense slew of alternatives out there to satisfy that kind of gaming need. No, I need a compelling main character pursuing a well-crafted, urgent narrative, along with a backstory fully supported with effective, entertaining documentation, not the brief, rare letters etc that turn up, now and then, in ACV.The overall sequence of separate story arcs just dont feed into the long-tail clash between the Assassins and the Templars, and even the loggerheads between Eivor and Sigurd was just not enough to give the entire game a coherent identity. I could go on about how activities of all kinds seemed to be far more difficult and onerous than in the previous games (almost as if these were tactics designed to mushroom the time you need to spend playing it!) but others have gone over that in detail. For me, it was the huge lack in compelling characterisation that did the game in - hope that someone at Ubisoft is listening to these complaints.",negative

When I bought the game i expected the historical tourism, combat, and exploration to be the soul keeping me playing, the exploration standing out most, though was dampened by a combat system that makes reaching any new destination stale.Don't buy this game, and keep an eye out for those responsible in creating this travesty, between the world design and ideological need for modern diversity where a very real ethnic and cultural conflict was taking place.

Assassin's Creed Valhalla,"Ubisoft. Get your â¥â¥â¥â¥ together. Was pretty excited for this game and finally bought it on sale after years of eyeing it. That my first mistake.The game crashes constantly. It's not a problem with my PC, I can run all sorts of big name titles like cyberpunk 2077 and fallout 4 without the same issue. You'd think a software that's three times the size of a standard title of the same caliber would have fixed that.On top of this, after you spend three days and three nights downloading their game that you paid for; Ubisoft requires that you create a Ubisoft account so they can mine you for data. You can link it to your steam account so they have even more access to more data if you feel like not having to log in literally every time you start the game (which will happen a lot because it crashes constantly).Lastly, not the biggest deal but microtransactions are everywhere. The creativty that went into the game is really overshadowed by the level of corporate greed that's transparently on display here. This game took something that was awesome in theory, and then absolutely â¥â¥â¥â¥ the bed on execution.We deserve better people. Speak with your dollars. Don't buy into the marketing and hype. Don't buy Ubisoft.",negative

Assassin's Creed Valhalla,"I read it was repetitive before I bought it, but I like the AC games so I thought why not give it a go anyway. Well.. wasted my money there. Besides the repetitiveness, the game has way too many visual bugs, annoying controls, bland storylines, no ending (?) and so on. Did 80 hours to finish the story. 60 hours too long if you ask me.Every assasination you do feels empty, even NPC's get more animation in their killing. Also the whole 'present-day' story doesn't add anything to the whole. So if you like AC-games, don't go for this one. If you like grinding a mediocre open-Viking-world: this is your game.",negative
Assassin's Creed Valhalla,"I've tried to endure this game for 35 hours and I just can't do it anymore. Origins was great. Odyssey was fantastic. Valhalla is shocking. The biggest step backwards in the franchise so far.You're not an assassin anymore, you're a raider. After two or three raids you get bored of the linear concept but soon realise that's a lot of what you'll be doing as Eivor. But I want to be an assassin.. because it's Assassin's Creed? The raid mechanic is flawed - you'll spend more time asking for 'help' from someone to open a treasury door with you(!), and finding keys, then you will fighting armies. Not the viking immersion I anticipated in the slightest.Raids aside, you get pushed and pulled into repetitive tasks trying to form alliances up and down the country. In small doses this wouldn't be so bad, but multiply this over every attempted alliance and you soon realise that it's a copy & paste routine. A routine that is sadly combined with a shallow, uninteresting and mundane experience. The world isn't alive, it feels dead.Combat has introduced stamina, which circumvents the fast paced nature of fights. You now run into a fight and swing your weapon, then wait, wait, roll, wait, wait, watch the stamina bar, then get hit, then ready to attack, the enemy blocks you two or three times, your stamina is depleted, meh.. interest lost. Not to mention the sheer lack of animations. Surrounded by 5 guys with swords & shields? Get ready to see that sword through the chest stun finish 5 times.I have come across no good loot in 35 hours. I repeat, I have come across no good loot in 35 hours. In this time I've found half an armor set, a handful of measly weapons that you'd purchase at a Blacksmith, and a set of trinkets I can sell whenever I visit a Vendor. What's the point?The Skill Tree is awful. It interweaves melee, ranged and stealth skills into a constellation network which is all over the place. You have no idea what to unlock, what that would lead onto next, and what it would lead onto in the future (because the tree conveniently hides it until you reach further areas). It is completely pointless. Odyssey made it simple - you could choose almost any skill in any order and then 'master' them down the line to flesh out what build you were going for. Valhalla.. no idea. A scrambled, messy approach where I ended up just unlocking anything for the sake of it. I just want specific skills in specific trees. You had it on point in the game before.Characters are easy to forget and pale in comparison to Odyssey & Origins - they just seem so devoid of creativity. The only character I really cared for was Thegn Oswald, other than that I found myself skipping through more and more conversations. Eivor (main character) & Sigurd are absolutely boring, I hate to say it but it's true.Odyssey is the greatest AC experience, and one which I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of through over 250 hours.Valhalla is the antithesis: a culmination of poor & generic decisions. It's completely stripped of what made Odyssey brilliant. And somehow, someway, this mess fumbles together into a file size of 158 gigabytes, without Steam achievements of course, because why would Ubisoft bother to give Steam and its customers any consideration after exclusively staying away for two years?",negative

Activities are, legendary animals, chests, chests, chests, chests, chests, and more chests.- exploration is not rewarding, they force to explore in order to upgrade stuff.- all stuff looks exactly the same- game is capped by levels, you are forced to complete areas to progress.- grinding materials, boring and pointless- skill tree, the worse skill tree i have ever seen in a video game, pointless useless stuff, an assassin should already possess.. you're not an assassin either.- parkour, non existent, only open vast fields with grass and trees, 0 planning in towns when it comes to parkour either.- performance, multiple crashes, constant crashes.- 2020 game... with 2013 visuals and 2010 animations.- actors are cringe and as bad as you can think, i have seen better amateurs, game is full of bad jokes and people who try to cry and look sad, but i have seen 9 years old kids pretending much better.- not an assassins creed, eivor does leap of faiths and everything else and he knows nothing of the creed.- every one of the systems are for refined nor polished, for example, fishing.. fishes get constantly stuck in objects.- combat is super clunky, movement is horrible and robotic- story? none, i cant rememer a single character other than alfred, and that is why i already knew him before this game lol- RPG formula- Super human powers , even though he possess no piece of eden, yea pieces of eden, the excuse they used on odyssey for jumping off cliffs and surviving.- invisible halls in multiple places while running or parkouring, in stairs, some roofs, making impossible to go forwardpros- music- setting (main reason i like the game, medieval. dark ages)- being a guy who loves history and the viking invasions- social stealth- puzzles / tombs- town management- siege battles- monastery raids (but sadly not rewarding enough, since they only give materials for your settlement and none for you)- river raids- norway, literally the best part of the game, which is the prologue.A Ubisoft OriginalAssassin's Creed: Crash to Desktop139.99â¬Is it worth it for assassins creed fans? Definetly not, horrible AC game, do i recommend for anyone else? if you can get it for less than 15-20, maybe. only maybe.

Assassin's Creed Valhalla,"WHEN ACHIEVEMENTS ARE ADDED THIS WILL BE POSITIVEi love the AC series and have enjoyed them all, when Origins and Odyssey was released (the best 2 games in the series) Ubisoft added full steam integration and achievements, surely this was going to be the norm going forward, then they left steam (for good they said) never to return cause steams model was unrealistic and unreasonable. couple of years later after losing millions ubisoft returns to steam, only this time have decided to spite valve and all the of steam community by doing only partial integration = NO ACHIEVEMENTS, even though if you open their launcher you can see all of them there in the same spirit as the last 2 games, they just cant be bothered to add them to steam cause they wont admit that valve has the superior product and larger client base, a huge middle finger to all of us.Apart from the above Valhalla crashes to desktop constantly, all drivers updated, running as admin, tried capping frames, fullscreen mode, updated windows and closed background applications. nothing fixes it, sometimes i can play for 3-5 hours np, sometimes i crash 4 times an hour... maybe if you had your silly game on steam from the get go where the community could have reported the issues accordingly your game wouldnt be such a mess after such a long time? all in all ubisoft has turned out to be one of the worst companies in the world at this point, even EA games have returned with full integration and achievements for all their new titles... ubisofts actions over the last couple of years and their spiteful return to steam has made me weary, just leave steam for good ubisoft, honestly if you cant come back in a proper manner like most other companies dont bother at all, i dont care anymore. i got this game gifted, wouldnt have bothered otherwise.",negative

Umineko When They Cry - Question Arcs,"I was told umineko as a visual novel was a master piece. its not. I was lied to, its far from it in fact unlike the real masterpiece known as Higurashi. umineko is where the entire when they cry franchise fell apart o where do I even begin, the fact that the entire core theme of this is based on ""everyone has their own truth and you cant prove them wrong."" is just false for one.  You can objectively prove communism is evil and for all those memes of Erika being a redditor youre actually wrong. Real people or even areal Christians should believe that god is real objectively and everyone else is wrong, Erika is infact the best girl of the series dare, I say maybe even the best of when they cry as a whole aside from Rena Ryuugu,the fact that ppl hate Erika so much says so much about how unserious they are. They are infact the redditors projecting their own stupidity onto Erika, Erika is the only reasonable character in the entire vn #1 girlthe other thing I want to trash on this vn for is how much filler it has for a story that can easily be boiled down to like at max maybe 4 chs, like damn I really wanted to like this series a lot bc it came from the same guy who made Higurashi and while it has similar themes they are so darn different in terms of their story and core messages. Higurashi excels in friendship and accepting others eventually helping them change their ways from doing something drastic, it also tells you how subversive fascists and people in the government can be, but umineko on the other hand is about this rick n morty reddit tier everyone has their own truth like there's a reason why almost no one who reads Higurashi first likes umineko more, most of us Higurashi fans think this umineko is overrated as hell and its partially why I'm so disappointed like this vn cant even manage to base its location on a real place unlike Higurashi, should have known this visual novel was trash from the get go when it decided to be based around some mansion with elitist rich pricks instead of the countryside with based country bumpkins in rural japan.Last thing but umineko was such a mistake as a visual novel, that it birthed gou and gave us cringey umineko fans that say well durr ""gou is enjoyable if you read umineko."" and I've read umineko and my enjoyment of gou went down even further as did my opinion. People who think that reading umineko gives more enjoyment in gou probably have not even read Higurashi in the first place, or started with Higurashi later than umineko like seriously gou gives us this dbz naruto tier rip off fights that is stupid just like they were stupid in umineko and served no real purpose for the story. I still recommend reading this if you are dedicated to when they cry (by reading umineko project not actually buying this crap on steam) like I am but dont go into this expecting something good compared to Higurashi bc it is not, umineko a huge waste of time and commitment except when Erika is on screen.",negative

Umineko When They Cry - Question Arcs,bad & dislike :|,negative
Umineko When They Cry - Question Arcs,"Just read the manga or watch the Deen adaptation, this is INSANELY BORING. I wasted my â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ money. Trying to read this to fully understand Gou and Sotsu was not worth it, even ps3 mods didn't help; listening to voice lines does not make this story better, just makes it drag longer, Knowing I will never get back those 5 hours spent on furniture romance makes me incredibly mad.",negative
Umineko When They Cry - Question Arcs,"The only reason this game enjoys a cult status is because back in 2007 there were only about ten visual novels in total and it was really easy to stand out despite technical inadequacies.  (The original character sprites were laughable even by 2007 standards)If this game was released today in the state that it is, it would've gotten about 2 or 3 Steam reviews at best and would've been overlooked by most because there are better visual novels coming out nearly every week.Watch the anime if you're curious about the plot, but leave this fossilized turd in a museum where it belongs.",negative

Umineko When They Cry - Question Arcs,"*_* Great characters and setup but it all goes too magical and wacky for me, the first episode as a standalone is great, but IMO this works so much better without the magic elements being so ridiculous and in your face Q_Q",negative
Umineko When They Cry - Question Arcs,"This game is hot garbage. I do mean that. There is zero player interaction, this may as well just be a picture book. It isn't a game by any definition. But if you're into that: cool. It still sucks. The game features an interesting cast of characters with many complex relationships. But they don't matter. You might care at first. The game made me care for the first 12 hours or so. I wanted to know where the story was going. 36 hours in, and it hasn't gone anywhere. The game just keeps looping the same events, making them slightly more disturbing each time around. I really can't explain the full depths of the problems of this game without spoiling it, but since my main goal here is to stop you from playing it by any means I will go ahead and not even bother hiding spoilers. This is your warning. If you are really really really dumb and want to play this really really awful game, stop reading this review.Everything from here on is dedicated to helping you make peace with your incredibly intelligent choice to turn your nose up at this game and never touch it. So it starts with a premise of a fairly straight forward family gathering, it seems like it is going to be a murder mystery over dear old grandpa's inheritance. A bit cliche but whatever. I wanted to give it a chance. A cliche plot can still be well executed. This game is anything but well executed. You're just stuck in this same two-ish day loop watching the same people die over and over and over and over again. They just kept dying and by the time that half the cast had died for the third time you don't even care about them dying anymore. Also the plot goes from believable period mystery to bizzarre magic supernatural plot in the blink of an eye. It is nonsense. You're told to resist this witch, to not believe in her no matter what, despite having magic done right in front of your face. Despite the fact that's she summoning demons and dragging you through pocket dimensions, and teleporting and who knows what else. The sound track doesn't exist. I don't know why the game has it labeled as having a good one, the majority of the game is silent which just makes you aware of how much time you're waisting. The only sound effects is this one really really gross noise they play when gory stuff happens. Also: there's just random descriptions of really gory things for the sake of gory things. Just because. It got disgusting by the end.It is terrible. It is slow. Death is meaningless. Life is meaningless. It is all meaningless and stupid in the world of Umineko. Screw this game and everything about it. The game does one thing right: accurately depicts what it is like to be held captive and tortured by an annoying pretentious old woman. Who you're told doesn't exist.I hate this game as I hate hell, all Montagues, and whoever gave it such misleading good reviews in the first place.The buyer's remorse is so strong I haven't bought a VN since for fear of it being like Umineko.",negative
Umineko When They Cry - Question Arcs,"I thought it'd be a lot more like Ace Attorney where the information is slowly revealed to you and you learn with the protagonist about solving the mystery. Instead most of the deduction is left for you to do independently. If you're super invested in this VN like a lot of people are, that might be something you want to spend your time doing. However the question episodes are nearly 80 hours of reading, so for a casual reader like me who might do 2-3 hours a week, the thought of trying to piece together the mystery from 80 hours of content doesn't make me want to do so. Like I'm supposed to sit there and read a 20-hour episode and spot the inconsistencies in between all the melodrama and general anime stupidity? It's not even like it's a typical murder mystery novel, all sorts of bizarre things occur from unreliable narration that attributes happenings and murders to magic. I get what they're trying to do here, it's a ""game"" between you and the witch to try and explain what happened without magic. But I'm not really interested in crafting theories, especially if the game spends a huge chunk of its time teasing you--and boy does it. The author uses not one but TWO characters, including an annoying psychotic loli, to constantly make fun of the fact that you can't solve any of the closed room scenarios. Luckily Umineko is generally enjoyable to read but the game does lose a lot of value if you don't care about trying to solve the mystery yourself.Anyways the real problem with this game is it's the one of the longest things ever. I don't just mean visual novel, I mean the longest piece of written media probably in existence when you combine it with Answers Arc. There is no feasible way to read this vn and retain all the vital information without making it a full time job. Every Chapter also starts the same, with boring intros and starting with the same setup for the murders. Group of people die, Battler and co. cry about it for 2 hours, the witch Beatrice makes fun of you for another 2 hours, the number of people slowly dwindle, everyone starts going insane and accusing each other...end chapter. It's just too repetitive. I dropped this game at chapter 3 and just looked up some of the spoilers, and WOW, I am super glad I didn't read this whole thing, cause that's just a straight slap in the face to anyone who wasted weeks of productive time to read this nonsense.",negative
The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,"This is the best game I have played in my life, period.Normally, I do not write reviews so early, but this is like...my 12th playthrough? 13th maybe? Original translation, then evo version, KAI on ps4, KAI on PC, geofront version when it was available - all of those versions I have played. This one, is an ultimate Zero experience. Nearly an hour in game, and I can tell, that Durante is THE BEST developer for PC games and I'm glad he works on my beloved series.Do not judge the game by its publisher, as you would miss out on a true gem.Just give it a chance, and if you never experienced story of S.S.S. - you are for a real treat.Go, find what's inside the trunk in mansion during Schwarze Auction. Then protect it with all your power.Trails from Zero is an absolute masterpiece, and together with Azure, they are the best Trails games ever produced.Pro tip: feed the cat. ALWAYS.",positive
The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,"Can you play this game first in the series? Kinda depends what angle you're coming from, but let's see...Can you play it first and not be lost in the story? Absolutely, 100%. It has its own standalone story that focuses mainly on new characters and local lore, and will tell you everything you need to know.Can you play it first without spoiling the previous games? Again, yes 100%. It spoils very little about the previous games (the Sky trilogy). It basically says ""stuff happened"" and that's the about the extent of it.Can you play it first and still have the optimal experience? Not exactly. You will more understand the weight of some elements if you know the previous games, their revealed lore, the factions in them, etc. A few characters from the previous games show up again, and one of arguably the best character arcs in the series reaches its conclusion hereâhaving started 2 games prior. That arc still has enough buildup in this game to have some emotional punch, but it can't match what you'd experience if you played the Sky arc first.But ultimately very much yes, Zero is a valid and acceptable entry point. All the previous games are available on Steam and go on sale for cheap, so up to you. If this game interests you more than others, you can't go wrong with it as a first foray.",positive

The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,"I can see why so many people wanted to see this game translated. I loved the Trails in the Sky trilogy, sorta liked Cold Steel 1 and 2, but Trails from Zero seems the best paced of the series.PROS-CHARACTERS:Compared to some of the other Trails games, the main cast are much better developed. (I've heard others suggest this is because the main party size is small (4 main party members, plus guests), but given the large number of side characters these games manage to develop, I'm not sure that's the reason. Instead, I think it's how nearly every event advances both the overall plot and character development, either through revealing something about their past, showing the changing relationship between party members, or showing personal growth.-WORLD BUILDING:The setting is richly developed. Crossbell State feels alive. I loved wandering around the city during quiet moments or doing side quests that took me through the countryside.-NPC DIALOGUE:Like the other Trails games, all the NPCs have dialogue changes after pretty much every event. It's not just the usual 'comment on what's going on' dialogue you expect in RPGs. Instead, they all have lives that touch on the main plot, but are distinct from it, and some even have character arcs. It's not necessary to talk to them to follow the story, but it's always rewarding, whether for Items, foreshadowing, funny moments, or extra character beats for the main cast.-INVESTMENT:Because the NPCs are so well developed, the stakes feel high when they're placed in danger. If an NPC goes missing, it's not just 'some guy', it's a character you already know.-MUSIC:Not much to say. The music is amazing. I think I've found another soundtrack to listen to at work. But I think this has been a consistent strong point of the Falcom games I've played, including Ys.CONS-NITPICK:There's a 'beep' sound effect when you confirm menu options that I found grating. I see a menu option to disable 'beeps' but it seemed to only disable the sound effect that plays when dialogue is onscreen.-DATING SIM ELEMENTS:The game has an affection system that reminds me a bit of the 'dating sim' feel of the more recent games. It's a bit disappointing for me because of how well Trails in the Sky showed a canon couple. I like player choice, but affection systems often lead to an 'everyone is in love with the main character' feel that seems out of place compared to the rest of the character writing. It also means you would need to do multiple playthroughs (or do some careful affection management and save scumming) to see all the character moments.-MISSABLES:You pretty much need a guide if you're going to collect everything. Despite making an effort to talk to every single NPC after pretty much every plot event, I still missed some of the books and one recipe. Oh well. Something to do on my next playthrough.-SO ALONE:I can't get anyone I know to play these games, even friends who like JRPGs. My boyfriend has agreed he will play the entire Trails series if I finish all of Wheel of Time, so... well... that should keep me busy until Azure comes out, I guess?",positive
The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,"An exceptional port of an exceptional game.Durante already covered all the fixes and upgrades to the game, and we've seen Geofront's stellar work as well, but in case you need a refresher (all of this is just tech stuff, the game itself is fantastic, the Crossbell arc might be just two games but they're two amazing games):- Arbitrary framerate support- Arbitrary resolution support- Arbitrary aspect ratio support (yes, including 16:10 for us Deck heads)- Carefully upressed (via AI + manual touch-ups) textures and sprites, looking sharper and cleaner than ever, without losing any heart of the original art- All the extra voice stuff (sadly only Japanese, which is fine but personally I think Trails dubs are all fantastic and while it was certainly outside the budgetary scope for this port, I would've still loved to have the English cast)- Hi-res character portraits- QoL features including: better save system, music display system (shows what track is playing and where it can be found in the OST, optional of course), dynamic shadows from other versions, but redone from scratch and appear to be even better, option to display the sprites in their original ""glowing"" state or a very slightly darker/less glowy version, both look nice, turbo mode, faster load transitions (though you can turn on the slower ones if you like), support for other versions' saves (insane!), pause while Steam or other overlay is active, autosaves at desired intervals, show or not show intro movie, encounters triggering when a monster collides with any of your party or just when they touch the leader, UI scaling, full control remapping, deadzone options, different gamepad icons for each platform that you can select at will, full mouse control in-game and in-menu, confining mouse cursor to window (good for not accidentally clicking on your second or third screens), and I think there were a few more but this is already too long!- Optimized for the Steam Deck, i.e. power consumption has been reduced and even turbo is less CPU intensive, allowing the game to use up less battery, on top of having Steam Deck specific icons, 16:10 support as mentioned, the game runs absolutely flawlessly on the Deck and looks fantastic, and if you're total psychopath you can even play it with the touchscreen as you lick doorknobs or whatever someone like that would do.- This is both QoL and a Steam Deck optimization: Dynamic Steam Cloud support! The game uploads save files to the cloud without having to be closed, meaning that you can put the game to sleep on your Deck and open the game on your PC and continue from the same save! No having to close the game to upload to the cloud. This sounds like a minor feature but it's a game changer for Deck users who don't want to necessarily close out their games. ""But what if I finish playing on PC, save the game, then resume my Steam Deck session from sleep? Don't I have to close the game anyway to resume from my PC save?"" Nope! Just open up your menu, and go to system -> load and you'll have your newest PC save without having to close the game or even go back to the main menu! Not QUITE as slick as it automatically loading your last save upon turning the Deck back on... but not bad at all!If you want a review of the gameplay and story (besides ""it's really good and probably the best Trails has gotten once you play both Crossbell games"") then this isn't the review for that. Geofront absolutely knocked it out of the park with their original localization and QoL updates, while Durante and his team took the ball and rocketed into the stratosphere. Absolutely phenomenal treatment, several times better than many top-tier AAA games get for their PC ports, and I'm so glad.",positive

The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,"First and foremost, if you haven't played the previous 3 games (Sky FC, Sky SC and Sky the 3rd), I very much recommend you do so before playing this one as there are huge amount of major spoilers for those games and they're worth it.Instantly purchased the game at launch and have zero regrets, while there are some people that have a problem with the price point given the games age, I still wholeheartedly recommend purchasing the game, if the price point is a big issue 100% pick it up on sale.The game itself was absolutely fantastic and completely worth the price, I finished my first playthrough with 102 hours played (87 hours ingame) having went out of my way to TRY to find all the hidden quests, monsters, recipes and fish as well as trying to talk to all the NPCs for more world building, but even if you ignore the those aspects and focus solely on completing the story and requests the game is still PLENTY long with extra content in new game+.Music wise, it absolutely blew me away, of the games I've currently played (the 3 sky games, zero and CS1&2) Zero has by far my favourite collection of OSTs, and I've already held the other games in very high regard in this aspect.Gameplay wise, I'm happy to return to a combat style more akin to that of the Sky trilogy with some evolution on it, certainly felt like a mix between sky combat and cold steel combat, but it still leans a lot more onto the sky games way of doing combat, especially considering the orbment system is identical to sky. Difficulty wise I played my first playthrough completely blind on Hard and I found the game to be quite easy, I felt that all 4 characters were extremely powerful and had a good stat balance, most fights were fairly easy to exploit given the vast arsenal of tools each character has and how most enemies are easily dispatched by either a weakness to a certain element or status ailment.The port was very pleasing, I never had the game crash on me, the options menu was surprisingly robust for an old game and the speed up function is an absolute god send, the only problems I've found with it were some translation errors and (that I can recall) 4 speech bubbles that were left untranslated in japanese, however none of these were on the main story so it has absolutely zero impact on the experience.All in all, I would 100% recommend this game, the port is fantastic and even though the game is old, it's quite large and for it being the first time it arrives in the western market officially I would say it justifies it's price point as I feel it's important to support the devs and show there is a market for this series in the west.",positive

As a passionate fan of the Trails series, I have wanted to jump into the Crossbell arc for years, and it is finally here! And let me tell you, it is excellent! While it is not necessary, clearing the first trails game is highly recommended for the best gameplay experience. Shoutout to the Geofront team for working on the localization; you guys finally did it! The port ran with zero issues, the translation was spot on, and the additional features were a nice touch. Splendid work!Now, about the gameIn a nutshell, the reasons I'm particularly fond of The Legend of Heroes: Trails From Zero are these:Enthralling storytelling combined with immersive worldbuilding, all while setting you up for the extensive and ongoing Trails loreGreat combat mechanic â best experienced in higher-difficulty gameplayFine-tuning skills is one of the best part of the experience, especially when you have four party members and a plethora of options to mess around withTurbo-mode and resume option is a small but significant featureCloses the curtain to an unfinished arc of the Sky trilogy in a very wholesome manner; it brought tears to my eyesCurrent RigPlaytimeðââï¸The Not So Good PartAMD Ryzen 7 5800H32GB RAM DDR4RTX 3060 Laptop GPUSSD NVMe2560x1440Win11Average:60hMine:116.5hWhile the story is undoubtedly exceptional, the snail-paced build-up to the juicy parts, along with the overly winded dialog, can sometimes make things feel like a snoozefest.

However, instead of being part of the Bracer Guild, a non-governmental organization acting to keep the peace and protect civilians, you'll be part of the newly founded Special Support Section (S.S.S.), a division of the prestigious Crosbell Police Department (C.P.D.), the law enforcement agency charged with maintaining public order. You play as Lloyd Bannings, a rookie detective fresh from the academy looking to make Crossbell a lil better. Armed with your detective handbook and zealous personality against injustice, you'll be running from one place to another, solving case after case until you finally stumble upon your big break, revealing the state of Crossbell's management.Props to Falcom's design team; they did an exceptional job visualizing the beauty of Crossbell. From the beautiful flower field of the quaint village of Armorica to the picturesque waterfall of Mainz Mountain Path to the strange ruins of the forgotten past, each was done with utmost care to provide an immersive gameplay experience.However, Due to the theme this time around being a detective mystery, some parts of the game can be straining to read through; I'm talking about long-winded conversations between characters about cases and story progression. This drag is especially true during the early part of the game, but of course, things get a bit better after passing a certain point of the game. While I have no issue with it, as I'm used to reading through long passages, some people may not. In a nutshell, the game is closer to a visual novel than an RPG in storytelling. So you better get friendly with that X button, as it'll be your best friend throughout the gameplay. And another thing, aside from Lloyd, relating to the members of the S.S.S. might prove to be an issue as you won't get the complete picture during the later part of the game. The game drops subtle hints every now and then, but unless you catch on, some characters might seem shallow or just one dimension.The road to becoming the Ace detectives of Crossbell can be long and arduousAt the end of every chapter, your performance will be graded based on how you navigated the story: every choice you made, all the cases you cleared, and any above-and-beyond actions you took. Each of them will net you Detective Points (DP), which will unlock some of the best items in the game as you rise in the ranks.Now comes the tricky part. Youâll need to maximize your DP earnings per chapter to reach the highest rank. Sounds simple, doesn't it? Oh my sweet, sweet child, things are never that easy in the Trails Series. So, have fun exploring!Here's the deal with collectibles and achievements in this game, particularly those treasure chests, recipes, and books, ESPECIALLY those darned books, man. While there's a workaround for the chests, the latter ones can prove to be a challenge. You'll need to talk to the right person at the right time. Miss your window? Well, I hope you get it on your next run. Advice? Create plenty of saved files! Pay close attention to your detective handbook, as most of the achievements revolve around filling the pages in that book. The point is, if you're serious about total completion, be sure to check it every now and then.Lloyd Bannings, Detective 1st Class, reporting for duty.

Worth it!A Screenshot of The Legend of Heroes: Trails from ZeroBy:OkuuCombat in hard mode is the way to go, or nightmare mode if you want to spice things upTrails From Zero combat uses the Action Time Battle system to determine turn order, with each action having a base delay affecting your next turn. This system is too easy on lower difficulty. On higher difficulties, it can be unforgiving, even bordering unfair at times â Iâm not even kidding, you could lose even before the battle starts, imagine that! However, this is what truly allows the combat system to shine! If youâre up for some challenge and willing to experience and tweak around the seemingly simple yet complex combat to its fullest, I say play the game in hard or nightmare mode where a single misstep could spell doom for your team. But if youâre like me and aiming for a 100% run, then nightmare mode is the way to go, as there are two difficulty-related achievements. That way, you can get both in one fell swoop.Even the seemingly harmless enemies can wipe the floor with you in higher difficulty. Whack em with S-Craft just to be safe!A Screenshot of The Legend of Heroes: Trails from ZeroBy:OkuuYou will want every advantage you can get to survive playing on higher difficulty. One of them happens to be my favorite part of the game: tweaking the classic Orbment system and character abilities. Hereâs the thing: every enemy has a weakness that you can exploit, and Arts or magic are a lot more valuable than melee combat on higher difficulty, so start tweaking and exploiting their weaknesses like your life depends on itProbably not the most optimized, but it'll have to do. Heck, it helped me survive most battles, even made nightmare run slightly more doableA Screenshot of The Legend of Heroes: Trails from ZeroBy:OkuuTrails From Zero is the first to introduce the bonding system in the whole series. While I think it's nifty, it has very little breathing room if you plan on getting all bonding-related achievements in one run. It is doable, but youâll need to follow specific and strict instructions to do it. Do yourself a favor, find a guide and follow it unless youâre willing to do multiple runs. Knock yourself out.OverallOverall, Trails From Zero offers a compelling detective RPG experience and definitely a solid A from me â as expected, Trails game does not disappoint. The heavy-dialogue part might be taxing for some, but bear with me here! Behind all that lies one of the most amazing storylines, well-crafted characters, and the most immersive gameplay experience.

The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,"The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero is the best set-up game in the entire Trails series. No cliffhanger endings, a perfectly good story on all its own, yet with deep connections to Azure that are impossible to see within your first playthrough, and unsolved leads that make you wonder just what is going to happen to Crossbell.Starting with the setting, the City of Crossbell is the absolute greatest setting in all of media. Situated between and always being fought over by the two major powers of the Zemurian continent, the Erebonian Empire and the Calvard Republic, the Autonomous State of Crossbell is in one of the absolute worst scenarios for a country to be in. The political situation is essentially just damn near a proxy war between Erebonia and Calvard, which drastically screws over the citizens, with a majority of the tax revenue just going to either side. Despite this, however, the citizens still enjoy much prosperity due to Crossbell City being, essentially, the trade capital of Zemuria. Countless mira flows in and out of the city, all governed by the watchful eye of the International Bank of Crossbell (which, despite its name, has many branch offices in other countries). Department stores, high rises, and other such features of a prosperous city dominate the streets and skyline. But it is all a veil drawn over the eyes of tourists and citizens, for Crossbell has a much seedier underbelly.Nearly everyone in the government is corrupt and allies with one of the two major powers. Anyone who tries to make a change for the benefit of Crossbell is immediately tossed out. Not only this, but ties run deep with the Crossbell mafia, Revache. They pay off politicians in order to get away scot-free with all of their crimes. Yet nothing can be done about it, as those politicians are backed by the powerful benefactors of Erebonia and Calvard. It seems as though Crossbell's fate is to be stuck within an endless cycle of no progress.This is where the Special Support Section comes in. This newly established unit essentially seeks to emulate the Bracer Guild, which is much more popular than the Crossbell Police Department due to them actually being able to protect citizens, and having the A-rank bracer Arios MacLaine. Because they emulate the Bracer Guild, they can gain popularity with the citizens, and under the lax eye of chief Sergei Lou, they are essentially free to do what they think is best. With the backing of the citizens, the CPD will be hesitant to axe the unit. But this all comes with time, and Zero shows us how the Special Support Section rises to fame.Back to the Crossbell City itself, the city is littered with at least two hundred unique NPCs whose dialogue makes them feel as though they really are a live person living within the city, and not some generic no-name spouting either slightly plot-relevant lines or completely irrelevant nonsense. You will not forget these NPCs.As for the gameplay itself, it builds upon everything established in Trails in the Sky and makes it even better.All in all, the Crossbell duology is the best piece of media I have ever consumed, and you will absolutely love it to pieces. Just make sure you play the Trails in the Sky trilogy first.also lloyd bannings is the greatest of all time",positive

The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,"Trails form Zero is amazing. I bought this game foolishly thinking zero mean it was some kind of prequel or entry to the legend of heroes franchise, but its closer to the middle. But you know what? I'm glad this is where I started. This game made it to my top 10 RPGS of all time. Don't miss this one.Im a big JRPG fan, but some things about this game are special. Usually there are characters in jrpgs that i hate, but this game is filled with likable characters. Not only are they likable, but all of the characters almost feel like real people. A lot of the times jrpg characters are too edgy, or follow generic anime troupes, but trails from zero throws all that out the window and builds a cast of likable down to earth characters. I love the SSS and i am already eager to play more games to see these people again.But its not just the characters. Its also the world. This game is one of the 10+ games in the tails series, and even though this is the first one i played i feel like i already know a lot about the others. The games lore, nations, politics, history, culture and more are incredibly fleshed out and feel organic. For a PSP game with cartoony graphics, this game is surprisingly immersive. It also helps that the game structure follows a case by case basis, that feels more like you are doing your job than just playing a story. And I cant stress enough how great this story is. Its simultaneously light hearted and heavy, easily digestible yet deep, cinematic but still feels organic.This is my first falcom game. and 20 hours into trails from zero, i bought the trails in the sky trilogy. The trails series has always been interesting to me, but has always been a little daunting. After zero i am ready to make the plunge. This game is top tier 10/10 100% god â¥â¥â¥â¥. This is a must for any jrpg fan.",positive
The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,"Before I start let me say one thing: PLEASE PLAY THIS AMAZING GAMEThis game is so good yet I felt like this game is very underrated in comparison to some other JRPG here on Steam. I think part of the reason is because people kept saying that you have to play the entirety of (Trails in the) Sky Trilogy to be able to play this game. As someone who have cleared Sky Trilogy and CS 1 + CS 2 before playing this game, let me say this: IT IS PERFECTLY FINE TO START WITH THIS GAME.I'll just say that playing this game without knowledge of the Sky Trilogy is like watching Spider-Man: No Way Home without watching Andrew's or Tobey's Spider-Man Movies in the sense that you can follow the main cast story no problem, but there are scenes that just hit differently depending on whether or not you've played the past games.That being said, the story in this game is very good and can definitely stand on its own. This game follows the story of a newly formed police squad that handles support requests ranging from cooking 'peculiar' foods to monster exterminations. Eventually, they are tangled in the political situation of the very city that they lived in and are faced with the harsh reality plaguing not only the police force but also the politics of their world. As with all Trails games, the world-building is nothing short of amazing, and the way the world and its politics are explored is very well done in my opinion. The Sidequests and NPC interactions can sometimes add more to the narrative and make the world feels more alive.The game also has an interesting cast of characters, and I'll say that the game's cast is not only my favorite among Trails games (that I have played) but also one of the best casts in JRPG in my opinion. The one I want to highlight is the MC, Lloyd Bannings, who is a hard-working and strong-willed aspiring detective wanting to follow in his late brother's footsteps. Lloyd is basically a very lovable Shonen Protagonist who undergoes great character development over the course of the game. He is simply a fairly normal police officer who has a strong sense of justice instead of a chosen one like in many JRPG such as Persona or Trails of Cold Steel which makes him very refreshing to me. His friends often made fun of how cheesy he could be, but he embraced the cheesiness and it makes him more endearing as a character.Lastly, I'll talk about the gameplay. For those unfamiliar with Trails Series, its basically a Turn Based RPG with grid based movement and dynamic character order. It's very simple to learn and can be quite fun once you understand the mechanics. The game has a system called quartz, which basically determines what kind of spell your character can use. To be honest, I'm not the biggest fan of this game's quartz system because it's too restrictive (much prefers Trails of Cold Steel's system which allows more flexibility), but it is only 'kind of a hassle' in retrospect if you've played CS games. If this is your first time playing the series, the system can be fun as it provides a variety of builds for your characters.TLDR: Play this game because it has a great story and characters, fun gameplay, and amazing music. It will give you a great experience if you enjoy JRPGs. Don't let this game be underrated because it's amazing.",positive

The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,"Alright.The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zerois done and dusted. This is a reasonably lengthy JRPG that I played off and on for the last three months, but I really focused on it over the last week or so and wrapped it up today. I will say that although I spent right around 50 hours with the game, which is a substantial chunk of time, you could easily double or triple that, maybe even more, by exploring a couple different story options, playing on the higher difficulties, unlocking various things, and so on. So, there is definitely a lot of meat on the bone here.The Legend of Heroes: Trails from ZeroA Screenshot of The Legend of Heroes: Trails from ZeroBy:robilar5500You play as the four members of the SSS, a newly formed branch of the Crossbell Police Department. The SSS is dedicated to being more accessible to the people of Crossbell and working towards repairing the police department's mostly terrible reputation and trustworthiness. The Bracer Guild, a citizen organization of mercenaries, is the SSS's more popular and established counterpart, without all the rules and politics getting in the way, and so the SSS strives to make a name for themselves in this space.To that end, three young adults and a teen are brought in by the SSS's chief to handle all of this. Lloyd Bannings, the defacto protagonist, and a young officer who just wrapped up Detective's School; Randy Orlando, an ex-soldier and part time dating enthusiast; Elie MacDowell, a young aristocrat trying to learn more about the world, and Tio Plato, a teenager brought on from the Epstein Foundation (very unfortunate name) to test out Orbal Technology, and who has psychic abilities. The four of you, along with some people you meet along the way, begin taking requests from citizens, which range from finding ingredients for restaurants to solving missing person's cases to exterminating monsters. All in a day's work, lol.As you progress, you begin to find out more about the political corruption rampant in Crossbell and start having to find ways to navigate around the restrictions placed upon the police department by corrupt politicians and aristocrats. Eventually, you end up embroiled in a deep state conspiracy that has the potential to end life as we know it and humanity in general.The Legend of Heroes: Trails from ZeroA Screenshot of The Legend of Heroes: Trails from ZeroBy:robilar5500With that in mind, gameplay is a cool mix of modern-day technology such as guns; futuristic Orbal technology which blends fiber optic technology with magic to create unique weaponry, telecommunications networks, internet, and so on; arts and crafts, which in this game function as the magic system; and more medieval style things such as swords and halberds. Often, the lines are blurred between these things. Although dissimilar to Simon R Green's Deathstalker series, some inspiration was definitely pulled from those books. There is a decent amount of exploration in and around the city to go along with some dungeon crawls. Exploration is handled in partial isometric real time style. Combat is handled via turn-based tile battles.For the most part, combat is always the same at its core. What changes are the vast array of enemy types and the vast array of abilities, both your party's and your enemies. This serves to mostly keep combat from getting stale. Which is fortunate because this is a combat driven game in many ways. And XP is mostly gained by taking on as many battles as possible, made accessible by the constant presence of monsters outside of the city and town streets themselves. Established buildings are typically also monster free. But everything else is an encounter-fest. You can easily run around and past encounters, but generally speaking, it's not a bad idea to get into as many battles as possible.As mentioned, there are a lot of options in combat. The volume of available arts and crafts is impressive and increases as you level up of course. Both Arts and crafts are ability sets that you can use for attacks, defense, buffs, and healing. Additionally, there are S-Breaks, which are special abilities you can use when your craft points build up, which offer high damage (or high healing) options. Often, they can be used to affect multiple enemies at once. Additionally, there are synergy attacks. Some happen during the course of battle and allow all four characters to attack together. Others are even more powerful variations of the S-Breaks, where two characters can work together to create an even more powerful special attack. Healing, in addition to certain abilities, can be accomplished via items as per all JRPG's, and by finding spots to rest at. Additionally, levelling up does refill your health and tech points. Tech points are used to power arts. Craft point power up crafts and the aforementioned S-Breaks. as a nice added bonus, S-Breaks can be used outside of the normal turn structure, giving you the ability to make a bit broader use of tactics.As you complete requests and general story quests, you will earn cash as well as detective points, which earn you bonus items. There are a few categories of items. Weapons, armor, boots, two misc item/jewelry slots, expendable items such as health items, food, and so on which offer cures and buffs, and ingredients for cooking or crafting. Additionally, there are Orbments, which are crystals that also provide boosts or special abilities. Each character has many crystal slots which can be purchased, upgraded, and filled with crystals. There is actually a lot going on with game systems and character options as a result, and this also helps keep the game feeling fresh. You will upgrade gear periodically and upgrade your crystals periodically. Nothing is too complicated.The pacing of this game is pretty good. I thought the various requests broke things up nicely and the main story quests themselves were a lot of fun. It's quite well written with a lot of laughs sprinkled into an inherently dark story. I thought it was quite engaging. Additionally, this is fully voice acted in Japanese, with subtitles available. It seems like the translation to English was pretty spot on. I wonder how much different aspects of the story are in Japanese, but it was well done in English. I did also think hearing the characters pronounce their names was kind of charming and cool.Visually, this game is kind of a stunner. Not everything is amazing, but everything is very detailed. However, some things were amazing. Enemy illustrations were kind of insane. Character models were all believable, in that cartoon-ey JRPG way. Cutscenes were flawless. TheArc en Cielperformance was worth seeing. Just an all-around great job with illustrations, choreography, and general game art.There were a couple issues, however. For one, I thought gamepad play was a bit too loose and hard to control. I played on k/m for most of the game as a result. There was some input delay periodically, and especially after interacting with things. Also, the journal was ass. This could have been done a lot better. It gives you the most basic descriptions for quests you are on, often missing pertinent details such as locations you already found, where you were told people were going to be, and so on.I think The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero is an approachable game for people with any level of experience in the genre, with a fairly engaging story, relatable characters, and good pacing. It's easy to follow, easy to play an hour here and there is you're busy, and has a lot of NG and NG+ content. Definitely a game to consider playing, and probably a must play if you love JRPGs.The Legend of Heroes: Trails from ZeroA Screenshot of The Legend of Heroes: Trails from ZeroBy:robilar5500If you found this review helpful and would be interested in supporting my Curator group,Robilar's Reviews, it would be appreciated. Cheers.",positive
The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,"Trails from Zero is my favourite Trails game, and after playing the official western release of the game, my opinion remains unmoved. Sky SC and Sky 3rd were special games to me, but there's something about the SSS section that sets it apart from the Liberl folks' dynamics.The Special Support Section is a solid team, with a good leader. For almost the entire game, Lloyd was trying to get away from the shadow of his brother. At the same time, he tried to fill Guy's shoes both as a renown detective and a person who is revered by his peers. I feel a certain satisfaction in knowing that Lloyd is a mature and well-rounded character I have come to expect from a protagonist of Kiseki series.One of the themes presented in Zero is progress (or change) and how we shouldn't be afraid of it if we want to experience better lives for ourselves. For instance, Randy is a complex character despite his carefree and womanising exterior. He escaped a life of violence and tried to remake himself into someone who lives in the moment, enjoying the company of the ladies and Crossbell's nightlife to the fullest. He is a prime example of someone who isn't afraid of change but at the same time, he hides behind his carefree exterior because he ultimately hates the person he once was.As any metropolitan cities in the real world, Crossbell also shared the same type of problems, namely: organised crime and corruption. There's obviously an argument to be made that these issues are just a pale imitation of their real-world counterpart, however; the idea behind it is still very relevant, and the solution is as complex. The confrontation between Revache and Heiyue affects the lives of people of Crossbell in the same way that organised crime is affecting people in a real city.And of course, the total disregard of the authority of CPD due to corruption at the highest level of government which has rendered the police force essentially toothless, leading to public distrust. The SSS team spent most of the game trying to regain this trust back, not only for the good of the city, but also motivated by their personal drives. Lloyd is trying to fill his brother's shoes by being a remarkable detective people can rely on. Elie knows that getting rid of Crossbell's corruption has to start with regaining the public trust. Randy and Tio considers Crossbell their adoptive homes and felt certain affection towards it like Lloyd and Elie does.The pulse of the city itself is directly reflected on its citizens. The diversity of the location and the people it occupies presents a very real place which feels lived-in. For example, the Downtown District is occupied by blue-collar labourers, struggling artist, immigrants, and neighbourhood gangs. West Street is where middle-class citizens live, with upscale apartments, retired bureaucrats and entertainers, and also a safe neighbourhood for children to play on the street. East Street is an analogue for Chinatown, with market stalls lining up the street, eastern restaurant and cheap apartments can be found in there. The Residential street is where the aristocrats live, new money intermixing with old money, essentially the Crossbellan ruling class and the privileged.The issues faced by Crossbellans are also reflected in the variety of side quests. Although most of them are mundane tasks such as tracking down overdue library books or rescuing lost pets, there are a few quests which highlighted urban crimes, such as smuggling, counterfeiting and thievery as a result of social divide/poverty. I feel that these types of quests go a long way to make Crossbell feels like a living, breathing city.One last thing I shouldn't fail to mention is the soundtrack. While obviously, you have several really powerful tracks such as Intense Chase, Limit Break and A Light Illuminating The Depths, most of the time the SSS team will be travelling from one point to another. The town themes and dungeon themes are really excellent as well. They are very rich in texture while retaining some of the motifs we're already familiar with from the Sky trilogy. They are mostly composed by Saki Momiyama and Hayato Sonoda. Tracks such as Geofront and On The Green Road are very upbeat, while Mining Village of Mainz, Lemonade in Hand and Tomorrow Is Another Day sounds very relaxing. And finally, tracks such as Fulfilled Feelings and The Wind from Liberl are very touching and filled with nostalgia, and especially for The Wind from Liberl, fans of Sky Trilogy will definitely appreciate this track.Overall, I feel it's a very enjoyable and memorable entry in the Trails series, filled with many loveable characters with depth and great storytelling I've come to expect from Falcom. I probably have said it often enough, but The Geofront and PH3's work on this game is really something special. They are fans of this game, and it shows in every aspect of this official release. I might not agree with some of NISA's localisation choices in the game, and some text bugs remain unpatched at the time when this review is written, but my overall experience remains positive.Barrier Crushed/10. Will play again before Azure release next year!",positive
The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,This series man.. I've never seen writing this good in my life,positive
The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,"Very enjoyable game. This is the 4th game in the Trails series and the start of a new two game arc. I recommend playing the original Trails in the Sky trilogy before this to receive maximum payoff for a lot of the events and character appearances.The main draw of this series to me is the writing and story. Trails is unique as a JRPG series because it focuses on a lot of day to day life of the protagonists. In Trails from Zero, you are part of the police force in Crossbell city and will spend many hours of the game solving requests from the city folk. While a lot of people may find the story slow paced, once you tap into that vibe and start enjoying the world, itâs very rewarding. Especially since there are now 12 games in this Trails series now at the time of writing, that all connect to each other and build on the same story and world. You have to pace yourself when tackling this epic.Durante did a great job with this PC port. Everything looks good and ran well.Also every JRPG could do with a âhigh-speed modeâ like this one.",positive
The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,"Never heard of Trails before? Read this:The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero is thefourthentry in the long-running Trails (or ""Kiseki"") franchise and builds upon the events and gameplay of its predecessors. Unlike other popular JRPG franchises such as Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest, Trails games all take place on the same continent and have one continuous overarching plot. While each arc tells a seperate story, events from one game have consequences for future titles and old characters reappear.Can you still start with this one?You can theoretically begin with any game in the series, but I highly recommend playing the games inrelease order.Trails from Zero partly spoils events from thefirstthreegamesand concludes character arcs that began in that trilogy. The games themselves are also very good and are worth a playthrough.My review:Did you enjoy the Sky trilogy? Yes? Then play Zero. You'll feel right at home since Zero plays and looks exactly like Sky.Combat, story structure and quest design are virtually unchanged. There are new turn bonuses, new Quartz, new (combo) crafts and naturally, new cryptic and permanent missables that you won't find unless you're using a guide! I told you, you're going to feel as if you've never left Liberl.At first, I had a hard time warming up to the Special Support Section and Crossbell State, the new setting. Was it the lack of a certain twintailed Bracer? Who knows. By the time the end credits rolled, however, I didn't want to part with Lloyd, Elie, Tio, Randy and all the endearingly eccentric NPCs of this buzzing city state. While Sky had select standout characters like Olivier, Kevin and Estelle who all were peak entertainment, I feel as though the Special Support Section had the better overall group dynamic.The story also took an unexpected direction when things picked up, which was especially interesting after the events that took place during Sky. Can't wait to jump into Azure after a short break.On normal difficulty, I found the game easier than Sky FC. Losing fights is very uncommon, especially if you approach field enemies using back attacks. Bosses are on the easier side as well, the only somewhat troublesome encounters are the final bosses and optional chest / quest encounters, but even those can be overcome with little challenge as long as you come prepared.Conclusion:All in all, Trails from Zero is a worthy successor to the Sky Trilogy. While the gameplay is essentially the same as the previous games, the new cast and setting help to keep things fresh and exciting. The bar has been set very high and I am very curious to see how things will unfold in Azure.",positive
The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,"PlayThe Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky Trilogybefore starting Trails from Zero. They're story prequels and in my opinion mandatory to get the full grip of the story.The title once again fills a gap in the eventful universe of political unrest and fantasy creatures. Admittedly, this gap is much larger in Europe, since we are still missing important offshoots of the series, but the European premiere of Trails from Zero is worthwhile. Developer Nihon Falcom shows us once again who creates the most excellent JRPGs on our screens.StoryProtagonist Lloyd can also speak of a complicated return. Following a promising job offer from the Special Support Section (SSS), the young model student returns to his home country after successfully completing his training at the local police academy. The small town of Crossbell not only offers professional opportunities, but old friends are also waiting for a reunion. However, they make themselves scarce for the time being, and our new position in the special unit is also a little different from what we had imagined. Instead of honorable service full of heroic deeds with the people in our arms, Lloyd first has to try his hand at laborious PR work for the local police - and that starts at the bottom. The police force has not enjoyed a good reputation among the citizens of Crossbell for a long time. Completely understaffed and permanently overburdened, concerned citizens prefer to turn to the rival militia with their needs.In addition to detective Lloyd, it consists of three other prodigies, all of whom have very special abilities, but just don't fit the job description. Tio, at age 14, is the youngest of the bunch and is actually only there to test the newly developed magic wand of the Epstein Foundation. Randy, on the other hand, already has combat experience, but more as a whipping boy, while Elie, who brings up the rear, has even put her political studies on hold for an alternative career.PacingWe get a cleverly built preview of later events, and they have a lot more to offer than the cozy opening would suggest. Such a spirited rescue mission in the branching tunnel system under the city already offers an appropriate prelude, but the later discovery of a nationwide threat by cultural forces naturally has much more potential to fully pick us up narratively. I won't reveal more at this point, as the slowly structured build-up of the story is far too exciting for that. However, it is clear that Trails from Zero entertains on a high level throughout its entire playing time of around ~50 hours and surprises with several twists and turns.I can feel Lloyd's initial euphoria, the disappointment over supposedly false expectations of the job, but also his enthusiasm to remain part of this unit, in order to do some annoying favor work at first, but ultimately save the entire continent from its downfall. It's exactly this slow pace that ensures that we merge all the more with the incredibly content-rich game world of ancient buildings and futuristic-looking technology. The cast plays to the same beat and uses the ponderous progress to develop comprehensively, build personal relationships with each other and share their own strokes of fate or motivations.CombatAt first glance, the battles in Trails from Zero leave a classic impression. Encounters with monsters of all kinds are turn-based, and all four party members can take turns hitting them, casting spells or using special abilities. Once all the creatures have been wiped off the screen, it's time to call it a day, and the rewarding final screen entices with valuable experience points and in-game currency. In addition to the strategically valuable selection of attacks, our position also determines the outcome of a battle. Most enemies are much more vulnerable from behind or to the side. The wonderfully refreshing tactical approach reaches its clear climax in the superbly staged boss fights. When we have to tactically maneuver all squad members across the battlefield, trying not to offer any open space, attacking and defending, and to top it all off, protecting NPCs, the RPG battles often feel like clever puzzles.A careful approach and a tactically favorable position are always important elements of the battles, and the relatively high difficulty level leaves no doubt about that. If we die, we can then either load an automatically/self-created save or simply start the fight from the beginning. Enemies are always visibly scurrying through the versatile dungeons, which can clearly be used to our advantage. Sneaking up from behind, and we start the encounter with a small bonus. However, it only becomes really worthwhile if we stun the enemy with a hearty blow beforehand. This way, annoying pursuers can be shaken off, but the direct confrontation is at least as tempting with experience point multiplier, reduced MP and SP consumption and the chance to use an all-out attack, which lets everyone attack together and ends most fights immediately. Of course, the reverse is just as true, and we should always be careful not to let the monsters stab us in the back.But there is still character development. And as typical for the series, this is quite complex. Instead of spoiling ourselves with new abilities after a level-up, we learn skills and spells exclusively via previously acquired quartz. We can only train an effective healer properly if we equip him with the rare gemstone. This first has to be found and correctly equipped or crafted, whereby interactions of certain combinations also play a supporting role in order to unlock particularly valuable abilities. Admittedly, you have to get used to this system at first. This method offers a particularly creative and experimental way of character development.My Opinion / CriticismMany dialogues and actions are very long-winded. This is especially noticeable in the first hours of the game. There is more reading than actual playing, and the title is more like a visual novel than an action RPG. Although this condition improves as the game progresses, anyone considering a purchase should know that a lot of time has to be invested in reading English texts. The exploration of the environment, on the other hand, looks slimmed down. Although the different areas in and around Crossbell are presented in a versatile way, they hardly offer any challenge. The path is often linear, and the treasure chests are hidden quite conspicuously.One positive aspect, which is common to most JRPGs, is both the high quality of the dub voices and the quality and coherence of the music. The soundtrack is really nice to listen to and adds the right spice to any environment or situation. Thus, even sometimes longer chit-chat moments seem less monotonous. The voice cast on the other hand shows once again that probably the best dubbing work is done in Japan. Authentic and diverse voices give the various characters valuable depth.ConclusionA storyline full of politics, intrigue and citizens looking for help awaits you in Trails from Zero. Although the dialogs are very lengthy and some tasks trivial, this game is definitely worth playing if you are into JRPGs. The chosen style of the environment makes the adventure in Crossbell its own, almost perfect world. The characters appear versatile, have a clear depth which can unfold during the course of the plot, and shine with a very strong voice cast. The different options to improve characters give you room to fight the way you prefer. Fans of JRPGs can't avoid this title. Curious players should be on their guard, though. The English only offered isn't everyone's cup of tea. Finally, there's just one more thing to mention: I'm looking forward to the upcoming titles in the series!Final Verdict: 9/10 - Very Positive ð",positive
The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,"In terms of the Legend of Heroes games I've played prior to this title, I have completed the first two Sky games (only lightly dabbled in the third game) as well as beaten the first two Cold Steel games. So this is speaking from experience of someone who is familiar (if a bit hazy since it's been some time since my last game) with a good bit of the world and the events discussed for other regions outside of Crossbell.Anyways, this game brings you to a different region than the previous games with a new main party of characters to adventure with and learn about. I continue to appreciate how all the dialogue really shows off their personalities towards each other and the situations they get involved with (and believe me there's a *lot* of dialogue), that while it's hard to be better than the original pair of characters in the Sky series, this group so far is pretty high on my list.The structure remains fairly similar to the other games, you are given side tasks to do within a specific timeframe of a given chapter, along with main task(s) which advance the story. It's a solid setup that gives you some freedom in how to tackle things, as well as giving you more information about the world and the various NPCs to interact with. It is a fairly sizeable area you can run around in, and fortunately there are some quality of life options to make things easier (more on that later). The story starts generally in a standard way with hints of more, and it expands well into bigger plot beats which have their own huge twists and turns. Since this is part of a continued story with Trails to Azure, there of course will be more to come for those that enjoyed the story of this game. I am definitely excited to see more of these characters and what's next for them after the finale of the first game.Battles remain centered around tactics, dealing with positioning for both attacking and defending. Most of the battles were fairly simple and easy to win with a group attack, but the bosses and more unique enemies can definitely give you a run for your money if you don't at least have a plan outside of ""expend all my special attacks and hope for the best"". I personally beat the game on the hard difficulty and I had multiple instances of bosses really requiring me to either rethink my general strategy or switch up equipment to counter any specific attacks/debuffs they'd try to use. As a warning, you cannot change the difficulty after you've started, so if you're having issues, it's either gain levels / buy better equipment.One thing I'd like to point out is that this game was just perfect for me on the Steam Deck, for the following reasons:-You can set the game launch to just load your latest save which puts you immediately where you left off, no logos / title screen / anything.-It has a fast forward dialogue option (which moves things pretty fast) for when you have to re-watch a scene but need to skip through-It has a high speed option where everything moves quicker (exploring / battles / etc.). I exclusively played in this mode aside from some battles where I needed a bit more leeway when to use special skills, and I ended up completing the game in ~30 hours.-Battery life was great even on the default settings, could play for long sessions and not immediately drain it.-You can save anywhere unless you're mid conversation, and you even can setup auto-saves that save every [x] minutes.This series continues to be an investment for people that enjoy this world (and the little things like how NPCs change their dialogue after most story events which gives them a bit more personality), but in my view, a worthwhile one. I won't be stringent and tell people that they must play [x] Trails game before the others, but I think this one is a good starting point, and it even may pique your interest to try out the others.",positive
The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,"Trails from Zero provides a familiar Trails experience that successfully moves the focus onto a new region in Zemuria while introducing a decent new cast of characters to follow. However, the game is very much a (slower) âset-up chapterâ for things to come, not offering a complete story on its ownDespite being the fourth game in theTrailsseries, it tookTrails from Zeroan astonishing amount of time until it received a worldwide release in 2022. Part of the reason for this would be its tumultuousport history, though thatâs too big a topic to cover here â the short version is that this PC version sold on Steam is also the most feature-complete and prettiest version of the game you can currently get.SinceTrails from Zerois the first half of a new story arc set in the Crossbell region of Zemuria, one might wonder if itâs necessary to play through the previous story arc, set in the Liberl region, first. In my opinion, the answer to that question is yes, youâll need to start with the (very fun!)Trails in the Sky FCand its two sequels first. Sure,Trails from Zeromight not be a direct sequel toTrails in the Sky 3rdand features only a few spoilers regarding the previous events in Liberl on top of an already pretty self-contained plot, which means even newcomers to the series shouldnât be lost when following the story. However,Trails from Zeroalso contains the conclusion to an important ongoing character arc from the previous games, which is the main reason why I recommend playing through theTrails in the Skytrilogy first â these character moments wonât feel nearly as rewarding/emotionally impactful otherwise.In terms of gameplay, thereâs also little reason to start withTrails from Zeroinstead ofTrails in the Skyanyway since the improvements here are once again on the smaller side of things. The grid & turn-based combat system remains almost the same asTrails in the Sky 3rd, though thereâs fewer Quartz and Slot levels now. The main addition here (besides the updated menus) are Team Rush attacks (= a new battle order bonus) and S-Craft attacks involving other team members, both of which are nice to have but not really shaking up the gameplay in any meaningful way. The gameplay loop ofTrails from Zerois about the same asTrails in the Sky FC & SCâ tackle main quests to advance the story and take care of side quests as well as collectables/minigame stuff in between.Since the Crossbell region is mostly just the (big!) city of Crossbell and a few villages next to it,Trails from Zerois a much more condensed experience than Liberl however, less about travelling the world and more about travelling through familiar streets. This doesnât stop the game from featuring a maddening amount of missable content however, which is why I recommend usingguide such as this one[gamefaqs.gamespot.com]if you want to engage with all the hidden side-quests & more. The game is unnecessarily strict when it comes to missable content, even more so than its predecessors, which can be quite frustrating â one particular side-quest is locked behind completing (almost) all quests in the game in a perfect way for example. Thankfully, amongst other improvements, this PC version ofTrails from Zeroalso contains a turbo mode, which can be used to speed up tedious battles or occasional less-imaginative fetch quests.As with the previousTrailsgames however, the main draw ofTrails from Zerois once again the story, itâs world building in particular. After the30+h epilogue of the Liberl arcthat wasTrails in the Sky 3rd,Trails from Zeroswitches perspective to keep things fresh while simultaneously not feeling out of place â heading to the already teased location of Crossbell, a nation caught between two big political nations and a city suffering from a seedy underbelly as a result. Instead of following the journey of the Crossbell Bracer Guild branch however, the new protagonists are part of newly founded police force to rival the popular guild - the Special Support Section.Switching from Bracers to police officers allows for new story opportunities andTrails from Zerodoes have a bigger focus on (Crossbell) politics than previous games as a result. Still, unsurprisingly, the new perspective doesnât stop the game from excelling at building up its world and characters once again. The different districts, factions and inhabitants of Crossbell are carefully crafted, making for a unique setting with lots of potential for interesting stories.Unfortunately, similar toTrails in the Sky FC, this careful approach to worldbuilding once again turnsTrails from Zerointo a slowly paced game with a lot of small events before gradually increasing the scale of things. But most of all, itâs noticeable thatTrails from Zerois merely the first part of a duology: carefully building up the world but limiting the current story pay-offs, with a lot of questions being deliberately left open at the end of the game.Trails from Zerounfortunately doesnât manage to strike the balance between being a good standalone story on its own while setting up the sequel, as itâs leaning heavily towards the latter. In fact, it even fittingly concludes with the line âBut the story is not yet overâ¦, weâll see you again at journeyâs endâ. If youâre planning on continuing the journey with thefan-translated audio drama Road to the FutureandTrails to Azureanyways, this might be less of a concern - but if youâre planning on only playingTrails from Zero, be prepared to only see the smaller events resolved.Even the protagonists arenât fully developed, with significant backstory parts being only briefly talked about instead of fully explored. That said, the Special Support Section quickly grew on me regardless. Due to the lack of internal conflict, theyâre not as engaging as previous protagonists Estelle & Joshua, but seeing them work towards the goal of improving Crossbell and its police department together has been endearing nonetheless.Trails from Zeroalso once again features some great side characters that I canât wait to meet again â as well as a lot of great chest looting messages that really made me chuckle.Overall,Trails from Zerois a game for those who are already playing through theTrailsseries (or are planning to) with no intention of stopping at this point. Itâs a âset-up chapterâ for whatâs to come, with all the pros (thorough build-up) and cons (slow pacing, few pay-offs) that come with that. If youâve just finished theTrails in the Skytrilogy, consider if you really want to continue your journey right now, sinceTrails from Zeroand its open questions doesnât exactly make for the best point to drop off. If you are either new to theTrailsseries or are hoping for some significant innovations/a faster paced story afterTrails in the Sky 3rdhowever, this might not be the game for you.",positive

The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,"(I'm coming at this from the POV of someone who has Trails in the Sky/SC in their top 20 games of all time, but bounced pretty damn hard off of Trails of Cold Steel for several reasons [mostly related to the transition to 3D]. There will be no spoilers, & the focus will be on what it's like entering the world of Crossbell as a Sky veteran. While you can play Zero before Sky, in my opinion, you'll be doing yourself a huge disservice if you do, as the discussions of Sky's plot points, along with recurring characters, make Zero a lot more enjoyable overall).From the get go, Zero demonstrates many of the same qualities that make Sky as charming as it is; colourful, well-illustrated, meaningful conversations with even the most random NPCs, & a level of attention to detail that'd make most game developers blush. It's as close to a living world as you can expect to see in a JRPG, & the amount of dedication it must take to put a world like this together cannot be understated.The leads in Zero are all well-written, with each character having developed backstories that lead perfectly into their position within the game. The protagonist, Lloyd, is perhaps a bit more of a regular character than angry staff bashing nutcase Estelle (who is no doubt my favourite of the two), but he still manages to shine in a world full of great characters. The playable cast is quite a bit smaller, which on the one hand leads to more potential for deeper storytelling, but on the other, potentially limits the replayability if gameplay/narrative differences are you main motivator.The story develops slowly, starting off with mostly menial chores & odd jobs, but thanks to the quality of the writing & the charm of the characters, it flew by as I found myself engrossed with the world of Crossbell. It really ramps up towards the end however, & delivers a finale that's both satisfying in the short term, while leaving plenty of questions to be answered in Azure next year. Side content is great, with tasks varying from monster extermination to deeper, more meaningful content that adds to the story the further into the game you progress.While not a criticism by any means, Zero feels like less of an adventure than Sky; while Sky has you travelling the world from city to city in a manner perhaps similar to Pokemon, Zero instead prefers to focus its attention on a central hub, with a few paths that branch out into surrounding areas for quests & story development. This change in pace, along with the detective theme/deduction moments, make Zero feel like a game that, despite feeling very true to the franchise, stands alone as its own unique experience.Combat is as enjoyable, & there's plenty of variety to be had despite the limited pool of playable characters, but if you do a lot of the side-content & understand how to prepare yourself, be prepared to find some of the latter fights noticeably easier than some of the earlier encounters.Durante's efforts, most notably arbitrary resolutions/refresh rates, are a welcome inclusion, & the included high-speed mode is borderline essential. I used it throughout for combat & character movement, & if I had to ponder how much time it saved, I'd have to say 20 hours+, based on me completing the main story & all the (obviously available) side quests in around 30 hours on normal difficulty, while HLTB has the game's main story alone at 41 hours, & 63 hours with sides included.Overall, Zero delivered pretty much everything I hoped it would; strong characters with defined histories & motivations, a masterfully built world, political intrigue, & more charm than I know what to do with. The change from a globetrotting adventure to a more centralized tale results in something that feels both unique & incredibly familiar at the same time, & now the setting is established, I'm expecting big things from Azure in 2023.",positive
The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,"So keep in mind that I will write this with the Geofront port in mind, but I do plan to add my thoughts on the NISA release once I finish it.I will be honest, the Crossbell games are my favorite piece of media of all time, so you might be in for some bias hahaâ¦If you are at least somewhat familiar with the series, you might have already heard about Crossbell, and I assure you that finally seeing what transpired on the city state will be a one of a kind experience.Following the story of Lloyd Bannings and the Special Support Section, you will be faced with immense struggles and opposition from all sides of Crossbell while never giving up the hope of making even the slightest of change on an unfathomed corrupt system, even when faced with immense injustice.Crossbell State is what I personally consider the best location of the series by a mile, its unique noir and modern atmosphere, with extremely memorable NPCs and packed with secrets to discover, Zero is a game that will reward you for going out of your way to explore its world on almost every occasion, being it a chest, a quest, a book or even pieces of lore and worldbuilding.Now about the combat:If you are coming from Sky: It's literally just a better and more refined version of it on every wayIf you are coming from Cold Steel: There will be somethings missing (combat links and the wacky master quartz for exemple) but I'd say that outside of that, at its core is still the same, just less flashier and broken.If you are new to the series: Get ready for some of the most fun you will ever have with turn based combat, where even real time decisions can change the flow of battle (S-crafts). Iâd say its a easy to learn hard to master kinda of combat system.Iâd also recommend playing this game at least on hard if you are already familiar with the series combat, it's definitely one of the easier titles in the series.We also have the orbments, a really versatile system where you can make almost endless builds for any character (not saying they are all good, like trying to run a physical Tio lmao).Orbment talk can get a bit complex so I wonât go in depth into it here, but it really is one of my favorite systems to mess around on any game I've ever played.Music, as always, is phenomenal, with Zero featuring some of the most iconic tracks in the series.I could go on and on about this game but it would turn more into a essay about why I love this game so much, Crossbell really has a special place on my heart and it inspired me on so much, but Iâd guarantee that this game will not disappoint, it really is what I consider a perfect Kiseki story, with the SSS never leaving my head months after finishing Azure and after playing Cold Steel even, and finally seeing Lloyd on the spotlight and receiving so much love and care on heâs games makes me more happy than anything.On a last note, Iâd like to say that I'm really disappointed in NISA actions towards the Zerofield team and condemn them for it. My support of this game in this review goes to Durante's team and Falcom's, as well as a mini love letter to Zero itself.If you read everything, know that Iâm really grateful and really hope you have a good time with the Crossbell Police Departmentâs Special Support Section.Edit: A few hours in and I can already tell this will be the ultimate version of Crossbell on a technical viewpoint, it has the absolute best of all the previous releases combined, Durante and his team absolutely nailed it.",positive

The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,"The first game in the Crosssbell arc of the Trails series, and a pretty good (albeit not perfect) entry for newcomers to the Trails games.Instead of the idyllic Liberl Kingdom, we get to see the bustling city of Crossbell, showing us both the beauty and the ugliness that its at the heart of it. Whereas the Sky games were still relatively simple and mostly devoid of a complex political landscape, Crossbell is in some ways moving the series forwards towards more interesting questions, showing us how the city's future is not really in its own control.  Can our heroes overcome this barrier and shape the city towards a brighter future?I loved Zero immensely. The myriads of NPCs you get to follow over the course of the game really gives the city of Crossbell a true character that no other location in the series, from both past and future games, can match.  The music is also really amazing, some all time classics from  Falcom's  Soundteam JDK in there.",positive

The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,"After a decade, this game has finally gets an official port. Few years back, people thought this game would never see the light at the end of tunnel. But here we are, an official port on Steam! Such a phenomenal moment for fans of the Trails games. The port is absolutely terrific, so much work has been done to make it much better than ever before.Trails from Zero is the 4th installment in the Trails game franchise. In terms of story, you can start with this game with no problem, but I would highly recommend to play the previous games (FC, SC & TC) as well as they are all absolutely fantastic in terms of story and characters. Based on timeline, Trails from Zero takes place after TC and at the same time as Cold Steel I, and you'll see some overlapping moments in the story. Cold Steel II and Trails from Azure (the sequel for this game, coming next year!) also takes place at the same time in different regions.Trails from Zero has a really good story and I would suggest finishing this first before Azure comes out - which is still a ways off (in 2023) - as it gets insanely better(Finished this game before so I reviewed early)",positive
The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,"Truly a great JRPG, the gameplay mechanics are quite similar to other Trails game, which is a good thing, don't get me wrong. The core gameplay of Trails is already very good since the beginning, and Zero didn't do much to change it. A fine crafted turn based game, not quite hard to learn and I'm sure everyone who loves turn based JRPG will enjoy Zero. The balancing of this game is surprisingly well made. I played the game at normal difficulty, and I had no problem in finishing it. Zero has no such thing as âan incredibly annoying dungeonâ like so many other JRPGs, so thatâs a surprise to me, but indeed a welcome one.About the story, Zero is the first game in the duology of Crossbell arc. Some fans claim that this arc is the best so far. Now I didn't play all of Trails to know if that is true or not, but surely Zero has an incredible story. Zero tells the story of the Special Support Section aka SSS, a new division of Crossbell Department Police. The situation in Crossbell is dire, and complicated. Citizens have lost most of the faith in the police, because of all the corruption and incapability of the force. Newly graduated detective Lloyd Bannings just returned from the academy, and he wish to uphold the mission and his own dream of become an excellent detective like his late-brother. But then, he was appointed to the SSS, along with 3 more persons: Tio, Randy and Elie. First, Lloyd didnât quite enjoy the idea of the SSS, but then, little by little, investigation by investigation, Lloyd and his friends are capable of becoming the new symbol of hope for Crossbellâs people. There are many barriers that hold back them, but our team did manage to overcome all of it. There is a certain point in the story, that Lloyd literally overcome a real barrier, what a legend. Following the footsteps of our characters, surely youâll come to love them, not just the SSS team, but also the supporting characters as well. Theyâre all well-written, they have their own personal story, their own motive and Iâm sure you can sympathize with them.  After playing most of the Trails series, Iâm still amazed with the efforts of the writers in creating such a huge and memorable world and characters. Absolutely love it.Definitely a must play, and maybe a perfect entry point for new fans. 10/10 would overcome the barrier with my beloved SSS team again.",positive

The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,"Trails from Zero Didn't Break RPG Barriers But Proves The Classic Formula Still Works Today8.5/10STORYTrails from Zero is the first game of a duology series for the Legend of Heroes saga so players experience half of the overarching story until its sequel, Trails of Azure, is released in 2023. In this game, players are introduced to the cast of the Special Support Section or the S.S.S. and side characters from Crossbell City who may appear in the later installments of the Legend of Heroes saga. Trails from Zero excels in storytelling by introducing memorable characters with dark histories and foreshadowing future events through the S.S.S.âs investigations and overworld locations and dungeons. For example, without spoiling too much of the story, players can deduce the identity of an alleged suspect in the game by paying attention to their clothing and background during one of the cases taken on by the S.S.S. By the end of said chapter, their identity is revealed and players who caught on are rewarded with the satisfaction or shock that their hunch or deduction was correct. However, even though players roleplay as being part of a police force, Trails from Zero is not a full-blown detective or investigation game like Ace Attorney. RPG and fantasy elements still cover half of the overall plot. In addition, there are returning characters from the Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky series, the first three games or prequels to Trails from Zero. A sub-story from the Trails in the Sky concludes in this game, but it may not impact the playerâs experience as much if they have not played the games that came before Trails from Zero. Nevertheless, the game explains their backgrounds, so players wonât be confused with their role and importance to the Crossbell arc and the Trails saga. By the end of the playerâs journey, the final chapter ties all the plot twists and mini storylines into one satisfying end.GAMEPLAYTrails from Zeroâs strength and weakness comes from its simple gameplay. Players are tasked with completing non-mandatory side-quests called Requests every chapter which would either fund the player Mira, the currency used to buy weapons and Quartz, or increase their Detective Points (DP). When players earn enough DP, they rank up their Detective Class and receive bonus accessories that can be equipped to the characters, enhancing their stats and resistances significantly. Afterwards, thereâs the main quest that would progress the story of the game. This gameplay loop will eventually burn out the player because most of the non-mandatory requests are fetch quests that arenât memorable and monster exterminations with minimal challenge. In short, the game offers boring experiences for the purposes of leveling up characters in-between main quests, although it does add depth to the lore and backstories of NPCs inhabiting Crosbell City and the villages found in the overworld. Another gameplay mechanic are Quartz and orbal arts. Quartz are equipped to characters and unlock powerful orbal arts, elemental or space and time magic, to damage and defeat foes, or they can use Crafts, a separate gameplay mechanic where characters gain Craft Points (CP) each time they damage or are damaged in-battle and spend CP to unleash powerful attacks or buff their party. The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel have since improved the battle system of the Trails saga, the arc that came after Trails from Zero, but the addictive gameplay loop of using varying orbal arts to exploit enemy weaknesses or initiating flashy S-crafts never gets old.MUSICAny individual can appreciate the work that goes into the Trails Sagaâs soundtracks, but it is more apparent in Trails from Zero. âWay of Life,â the opening soundtrack, encapsulates the vibe or theme of the gameâs plot. This classic rock OST sets up the romanticism and ideals of Lloyd and the gangâs story as they throw out cheesy lines before rocking the enemies with attacks. The original soundtrack fit perfectly to each location and fight whenever it is played in the background. More importantly, one musical piece stood out amongst the rest, and it's an OST called Inevitable Struggle. The synth and guitar used in Inevitable Struggle is played during intense boss fights, and it is easy to get goosebumps when it plays. This musical piece is reminiscent of Shonen themes played when protagonists of an anime are about to win after a motivating experience which perfectly describes the scenarios that play out during boss fights.OverallThe Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero is by no means a revolutionary game that broke barriers in the RPG genre, but its intricate use of foreshadowing and charming characters, simplistic albeit tedious gameplay, and hair-raising soundtracks are examples of why Falcom, the video game company that created the Trails saga, is still going strong in the video game industry today.",positive

The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,"Hell YES I recommend this fourth game! Easily for me the best game of all of them so far, people rage about SC but as much as I loved it this one just ticked ALL the boxes for me.GREAT characters with awesome stories, a brilliant main story with awesome pacing and side quests that are even better than the Sky trilogy's ones which if you know JRPG's, they tend to lack in that regard.Also massive shout out to Falcom for literally being SO user friendly, you can set up your game so that once you hit start on Steam, it literally loads into your game within less than 2 seconds because you can set it to skip intros AND automatically load your last saved game, so yeah 2 seconds flat. Also you can set it up for PS4 buttons, that's such an easy but appreciated tool for me and this is the ONLY game to do it in the settings!Loved it, 10/10 all day long, cannot wait to play Azure next ^^Helpful non spoiler tip:Near the mid way point, when you're asked to search the entertainment district: Talk to the Hawker dude at the bottom right of the map.

The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,"If the Liberl arc (previous 3 games) were the introduction to the world, then the Crossbell arc (this and the next game) introduce the politics of that world and the growing web of issues the entire continent will face in the coming 7 installments. The scope of story these games tend to take is, paradoxically IMO, vast without losing or glossing over the minor, zoomed-in intrapersonal moments:The days in the life of a slapdash police unitThe gang corruption at the heart of a tiny city-stateThe political drama of the continents biggest powersThe threat of an existential and potentially biblical crisisAll interwoven and inseparable, yet this arc manages to bounce between these perspectives in a way that keeps a consistent pace without losing a single thread. Personal, local, institutional, national, and even the metaphysical; each layer is given its due and incredible attention is given to the details of how they each effect one-another, all while remaining narratively coherent and theatrically/cinematically clever as all hell.And I haven't even mentioned the insanely smartly written characters. From international disasters to a private moment on an airship, this team can write for any occasion and they use that skill to full effect to make a gripping, all encompassing tale.The one thing I would have to warn against is I wouldNOT STARTyour dip into the series here. Falcom have taken a risk with this series and even though it's broken into arcs, every single game is a direct sequel; From the first one released in 2004 to the most recent one released in 2022, they are all designed to be played in sequence and expect as much from its player base. Trials from Zero is no exception, and while it is a separate arc with a new lead cast, there are integral events and characters toTHISgame's specific story who rely on your knowledge from the previous 3 games.To drive this point home:This is not an enthusiastic fan's recommendation to 'just play the prequels for the TRUE experience.' It is my belief that you will be straight up lost without the knowledge of the previous 3 games, and it is not written in such a way that it'll still make sense on its own 'so I can just play the prequels later if I want deeper details'. It's not just 'nice context to have,' as far as I'm concerned Trials in the Sky 1, 2, and 3 are mandatory to have any hope of keeping up and enjoy this installment and ALL there after.",positive

The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,"It's an interesting new setting, the new characters often feel familiar though as they used a similar formula to previous games.In the first chapters, the story is rather tame but it develops quite nicely and establishes a promising foundation for Trails to Azure. If the great final should be anything like in the Trais of the Sky trilogy ...Combat disappointed me though, to be honest. It's never a challenge on normal in the first playthrough - till the very last boss.And then you suddenly need to be familiar with all the potentially helpful spells, you never had to care about previously.  They could have done way better ramping up the challenge (and therefore the complexity).",positive
The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,"Comparing to Sky/Cold Steel, this game kind of gets to the point much quicker with less filler. Although I've played Cold Steel series before this game and thought I knew some of the major plots, this game GAVE me tons of surprises. I was completely hooked until the end. Combat is also much more technical and in depth comparing to Cold Steel. It has the quality of story telling from Sky and Cold Steel much less drag. Big props to everyone involved to make such a well ported and translated game, it even has treasure chest messages like Sky series.",positive
The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,"Disclaimer: Reviewed on release, at the time because I had played 60 hours of the Geofront version, opinions are unchanged after 130 hours and 5 playthroughs here on Steam :)This game is, in my opinion, the best start of an arc in the Trails series.For those who don't know what Trails is, it is an ongoing series of RPG's set within the same universe (somewhat like the MCU.) This game was trapped in Japan for over 10 years, finally getting an official release with the help of the Geofront, a group of fan-translators. This game  is part one of the ""Crossbell arc"" which runs at the same time as Trails of Cold Steel 1 and 2. This also takes place after the Trails in the Sky Trilogy.Gameplay-wise though, this game is basically where Sky meets Cold Steel as far as mechanics are concerned. It has a lot of great systems and gameplay, while also being the most streamlined region in the series. In a very good way.This game is set in the Autonomous State of Crossbell, the smallest region in the series up to this point. However, there is a lot to do, and the smaller size severely cut down on the actual time spent backtracking that existed in the Sky trilogy.The story of this game is basically an underdog story as the heroes try and root our corruption in Crossbell as things gradually escalate. There is a mystery angle to this story I absolutely love, and it really keeps you engaged. The game also doesn't waste as much time with the plot as Sky FC and Cold Steel 1.One things that should be kept in mind though is that a prominent subplot from the Sky games returns in this game, and gets a lot of focus. This subplot will probably be enjoyable to a newcomer but will mean everything to a Sky player. So keep in mind playing the Sky games will enhance your enjoyment of this story.The Soundtrack is also one of my favorites in the entire Trails series. I love pretty much every song in this game.Overall, if you play this you are in for a really fun time.  Let's Get Over the Barrier.",positive
The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,"Zero is more like a nine or a ten for me. The Crossbell Arc of the Legend of Heroes series arguably starts off stronger than Liberl's in Trails in the Sky.It's cohesively designed from the very start. An entire independent mini-country is open to explore with a sprawling hub city that you're compelled to travel through over and over again, with every plot development, and see how scores of NPCs are processing their impressions of a corrupt government, working on their next great shop item, or trying to make connections between friends and family. Crossbell as a locale is a perfect intersecting point for the surrounding larger nations to be vying for influence of -- and there are, interestingly, multiple people of influence from Sky appearing to play varying roles up until the very end.The main cast of four is a wise choice to start with to give players who are familiar with its turn-based combat system enough skills and combo potential to get cracking out of the gate. I was wary of how much I'd like this new team but there's very little worth teeth-grinding over especially as their backstories are uncovered. Lloyd has some of the cheesiest lines and is somehow a magnet for any female not already acquainted with the cool guy Randy. He does exemplify a good leader however with some of his fast-thinking negotiations and understanding of what it means to be a detective, more so than his other acquaintances.Unlike the junior mercenaries of Sky, Zero's main squad being caught underfoot of larger, competing organizations makes the Special Support Section's growth feel just as warranted.It is a little jarring to have no English voice lines, but other areas of its presentation -- the music, the environment detail, and the effects -- are still wonderful.To an extent, I can see this being an absolute drag to someone uninitiated. Without a guide, without knowledge of the hyperspeed option, without an interest in text-heavy storytelling, and without background info of some of the references that characters throw around, it'll be suffocatingly slow for somebody else. It wore a bit thin while playing blind to go to every inhabited location again whenever an NPC had something new to say and see if there was anyone offering a quest, a collectible, a new line of foreshadowing -- that could reward me for all this meticulousness. I think it broke-even the tediousness vs. the rewards.If there's anything lukewarm, it's the plot. I know what Zero sets out to accomplish to lay the groundwork for the sequel, but there are quite a few parallels to Sky in the manner and with whom, generally speaking, things unravel towards. The major difference is Zero's themes are so much darker, and the minor difference is really only which mentors are helping steer the conclusion; a part of which is somewhat of a love letter and kind of a cop-out depending on who you ask, but can only be understood in full by those who have hopefully been sticking it out this long through the Trails saga.I'm really looking forward to picking up Azure when I'm able to and seeing how this solid foundation makes for a larger impact on the wider, evolving world.",positive
The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,"Pros:- Great characters and story. This is my 6th âLegend of Heroesâ games, and I would say the story is significantly better than the âTrails of Cold Steelâ games though not as good as the âTrails in the Skyâ games.- I would also like to thank Nihon Falcom for not including another nonsensical betrayal sub-plot in this game. I know it took restraint. Yes, Iâm still pissed aboutCrowâs betrayal in Trails of Cold Steel.- Turn-based combat was fun enough but I kinda wish the Devs would try to build on the system from the Trails in the Sky games e.g. you still cannot move and attack on the same turn for some reason.Cons:- There are way too many missable and even hidden content that is too easy to miss unless you are following a guide. I only found out in Chapter 3 that every chapter apparently had hidden support requests. Unless you spoke to ALL NPCs between each story progress, there is no legitimate way to activate all these support requests apart from using a guide. Itâs â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ that I missed out on being a Rank 1 Detective because I missed the hidden support requests in Chapter 1 & 2.- I get that the Devs did not want to put a big exclamation mark on guest-giversâ heads as it would mess up the aesthetic but IMO, I should not have to use a guide to find quests, there should be proper in-game mechanics to direct you to quest-givers.- Similar to the Trails of Cold Steel games, few of a gameplay elements e.g. maxing out bonding with characters are only achievable on subsequent playthroughs.- Wish they had more budget to make more animated cut-scenes. In chapter 2, they tried to show a âbeautifulâ dance display but all the game engine could muster was making the dancers spin like a Beyblade and jump a lot.Overall, 8/10. Still a great JRPG despite its flaws. Now to play Trails to Azure!",positive
The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,"This game is a sequel to the sky series, highly recommend you play those to fully understand what is happening.Some pros and cons+Art style looks amazing, the improved graphics on this PC version makes everything more crisp and clear.+The story is amazing with lots of plot twists and a mystery story to keep you entertained.+Music is always a great thing in trails.+World building and setup, with like-able characters.+Game is very well optimized with a lot of options to fit any preference.+The voice acting being only Japanese does work very well, it really does add a lot.+-A lot of the combat system feels like Sky, but with a new way to move the camera during a fight. Still a very enjoyable combat system with complex orbments to customize your characters how you want to.+-Tons of hidden objectives, quests, decisions, and quests and chests you can only get on new game plus.-The last positive point above being said, translation was a bit off. A lot of the Japanese voice lines were either too short or long to represent the text. There was also a few text moments where it would be in full Japanese so you could not understand anything. It works, just some flaws and a minor gripe.-The opening movie doesn't play more than once, this is probably a bug no one talks about.-A  scene would have benefited to not have any music/a change of music so the flow of the game feels more natural and real, other than that the story is really enjoyable.This game is very strong in delivery and has very minor flaws which can be easily overlooked, if you like trails or jrpgs you will definitely like this. I did my first playthrough on hard difficulty, which was just about right personally for me.",positive

The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,"I have made incredible amounts of progress in this game and it just keeps getting better.  I did not expect anything less as a fan of Legend of Heroes series.  I am becoming more attached to these characters the further I play it and thus you bet your butts that the game has a 10/10 story and character development.  The music/sounds and combat, everything is good.  I also enjoy this detective role as it offers some interesting side quests that are bit creative and helps add to the main plot even.  You will have to just play to see for yourself.  Never ignore them as they are fun and add to the story.  Also, seeing Estelle and Joshua again several times makes it better too.I was going to wait until I finished the game to leave a review, but figured I go ahead give it my thumbs up.  This game's sequel is coming to steam soon too!",positive
The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,"Product refundedI mainly played on Switch and enjoyed the hell out of it. As usual, the first game in a Trails series is slow and from what I have heard the second one is a lot better. Unlike Trails in the Sky, you are limited to very few characters so you get the needed time to know them better. Randy being one of my fav characters out of the bunch. Other than that it's also a fantastic port. Not only do you get graphical improvements you also get quality-of-life improvements that make the game more accessible. Overall a very fantastic game that finally got its deserved entry in the west. Now we have almost all of the Trails games available on Steam!",positive
The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,"Okay...Its something that starts a bit slow, but luckily doesn't have as much to set up as Trails in the sky FC (ala the whole ass continent of Zemuria). Despite that, Things get cooking closer to the end, and I will say, this game does hit better if you start from the beginning tbh.The orbiments new setup for this game threw me off at first glance, but if you knew what you were doing in the previous ones, its aight. The combat in general feels a bit more streamlined, and works much better than before when you get used to it too.The land of Crossbell may be smaller than Liberl, but they did pack a nice amount of content into this one, and I felt satisfied throughout. THe characters grow on you pretty quick as well, and there are some pretty slappin osts here aswell.I definitely enjoyed this first romp in the Crossbell games",positive
The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,"Another fantastic entry in the Trails series. Great characters, story, music and some fantastic tweaks to the battle system since the Sky Arc. Highly recommended as always.",positive

The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,Maybe next century we'll get the official translation for the Calvard arc.,positive
The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,"An excellent start to the Crossbell arc. I was genuinely happy with how much plot was in this game despite being a set up game like Trails in the Sky FC. I was already engrossed with the characters and conflicts of the game and I'm guessing it will just get better with Azure. Also if you have played the Sky trilogy, the end of this game will make you ugly cry. You can start with this game but if you're willing to put in the extra time to play the previous arc, then please do, there is already a lot of payoff in this game.",positive
The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,its about â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ time we got this game and it only took 12 years to do it,positive

The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,"This is one of the best games in the series! THANK YOU FALCOM AND EVERYONE WHO HELPED LOCALIZE ZERO! From start to finish this game just doesn't let down, and the finale is one of the best things I've gotten to experience in a game.",positive
The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,"Amazing game experience, and I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes JRPG games. The story of the game is almost as good as the Trails in the Sky, and it complements  many things in Trails in the Sky, I couldn't be more satisfied as a fan of Trails series. Thank you FALCOM.Furthermore, NIS has done a great job of porting this game to PC, and this version's performance is much better than that of the Cloud Leopard's version. As long as you are familiar with either English or Japanese, I would recommend you to play this version. Although the game is famous for its English translation, I played it in Japanese and it gave me a fabulous and unparalleled experience.",positive
The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,"Start with ""Trails in the Sky"" if you're considering playing this. This game spoils A LOT of the main plot in the first Trails games, and is very similar in gameplay and tone. There's absolutely no reason to start here. Start with Trails in the Sky, and if you like that, then the second chapter. If you loved it, then you progress to either third chapter, or this game (Third chapter of Sky is kinda weak and does very little for the main plot of this series), if you just felt it was good but nothing special, I'd recommend not playing any further. While I love this series myself, the two first games are the absolute best, and if you aren't invested in the universe after playing them, odds are the rest of the series will not be to your taste.Anyway, Trails in the Sky. That one first. Not this one.",positive
The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,"one of the greats. absolute mammoth of a game series. slow to start, like all tloh first parts, but all pays off. and the sequel is not far off either. its pretty much perfect on pc, had zero issues and the game got a lot of great stuff patched in",positive
The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,I love Trails from the Sky and excited that it finally got translated. My only complaint is that their no one talking in English(I don't mind them talking in Japanese but I would of preferred English ) and sometimes when I go start the game it doesn't start and I have to press the windows button to actually exit out and try again(which helps out every time). But overall I enjoyed itt.,positive
The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,"Product received for freeWhile I do have my gripes with the game, mostly based on how much this game wastes your time with excessive dialogue and constant backtracking, I have to give full props to it's mechanics. The battle system actually makes you think about spell placement and timing, S Breaks are a great way to blitz a group of enemies quickly or do major damage to a boss without uses your turns and best of all you can customise which spells you characters master.The story is also of note. Not only do you uncover a bunch of interlinking mysteries you get to have some input on how they get solved. A good few of the characters are likeable too, although I have my issues with the main cast.You also have extra features to keep you entertained like cooking, with the food created giving restorative benefits, fishing to you know catch fish and best of all a decent Casino.I would definitely recommend it to JRPGs fan but I would also put an asterisk by it. You will need patience when playing this game. So make use of the High Speed mode, just trust me, you do not want to play this game without it.For my full Review of The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero check out my video here:YouTubeâ¢ Video:The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero Review - Game ReviewViews: 219The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero Synopsis: Lloyd Bannings returns to his hometown to follow his late brother's footsteps and join the Crossbell Police Department.",positive
The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,"This is an example of an old school jrpg done right and remastered right. I used to be able to game for hours straight but as age and real life caught on, my attention span plummeted and i have never been able to finish any game in the last 20+ years. The story kept me coming back and the combat is challenging enough that it doesn't get bored. No grind required but be prepared for some long dialogues which can still be easily skipped through with high speed mode if you choose to do so.",positive
The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,"Trails from Zero is a very solid and engaging RPG with a story centered around detective work, which is a nice slight change of perspective for the series. It doesn't cover any new ground for Legend of Heroes, but it plays to the series' strengths well. You should play the Trails in the Sky trilogy before this one and if you've made it through those, you'll have a very good sense of whether or not you'll like this one as well, as long as you're okay with no English voice translation.It would be nice to fight a major opponent who didn't transform into a monster at the end for no particular reason whatsoever, but I'm not sure that Japanese media is allowed to be released without that wrinkle at the conclusion of a story, so I guess that it gets a pass.",positive

The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,"[UPDATE]Updating this because NISA has shutdown the Zerofield translation project.I am one of the fans (And pretty sure there are plenty more) that happily supported both versions. Playing the fanbase translation never prevented me from buying the localizations. Now I won't be supporting any future project from them unless there's a change.Won't make a dent in their finance, but I'm not supporting NISA in this decision.[ORIGINAL]Installed it just to write a review to support this masterpiece. Nuff said.",negative
The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,"This runs beautifully on Steam Deck.Actually I am a bit floored by the quality of this port overall. I played the original DLSite PC version and the graphical differences really show.And to highlight even further on Steam Deck performance, I maxed out Anti-Aliasing and Anisotropic Filtering and have been running through the Geofront and Crossbell without a single performance dip. The deck is barely even warm. Fantastic optimization work PH3!",positive
The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,"I just finished the three Trails in the Sky games recently, and it was mostly coincidence that I finished them so close to this one's release.  TL;DR, Trails from Zero is a phenomenal JRPG and a top-notch entry in the Trails series, and you should stop reading this review and play it ASAP.I love JRPGs.  If you love them, you're doing yourself a disservice by not sitting down and playing the Trails games until your eyes are bloodshot and your pants are fused to your chair.  The characters, story, sidequests, and worldbuilding are honestly some of the best in any game series I've ever played, and the fact that I can play four of these sons of guns in a row without playing anything else in-between should speak to how special they are.  The sidequest design honestly reminds me a bit of The Witcher 3's, if not quite in terms of writing in terms of their effect on the characters you interact with.  Gameplay's fun too, but fast-forward mode and art/SP skip button will definitely be your best friend once you've been in a few battles.  Seen one ""Ore no ban da na!"", seen them all.If you don't like JRPGs, Trails won't change your mind.  If you do, even a little, you owe it to yourself and the hardworking fans and developers to play these games by whatever avenue possible.  Zero is maybe not the best way to start because of how much it references the Trails in the Sky trilogy and in some ways serves as something of an epilogue to stories from those games, but you won't be missing anything absolutely crucial to the plot if you start here.  I was a bit disappointed by the lack of a dub as I've heard the Cold Steel dubs are fantastic, but the Japanese voice acting is excellent, and the lack of Vita-exclusive sidequests means we'll probably never see a Zero release with those quests in them officially in the west, which is by no means awful, more slightly disappointing.In conclusion, 0/10, not enough Olivier.",positive
The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,"Bro why does this series keep getting better and better with every single game? I go ""man trails in the sky 3rd is my favorite"" and then this game comes along and shatters what i would expect a trails game to be.It takes a new narrative direction compared to the sky trilogy focusing more on a detective story about a group of rookie cops who are tasked with essentially doing dirty work for the police department and their journey as they slowly uncover the corruption and dark side of Crossbell(the city the game is set in) and their struggle to fight back against it. That is a super basic description of the narrative but the narrative evolves as the game progresses and what seems like simple government corruption slowly turns into something much more sinister. The plot has a bunch of interesting twists and turns that had me really invested and it gets especially insane later on.Speaking of Crossbell. It's hands down the best setting in the entire series so far. it's a massive technologically advanced city with tons of different areas and districts to explore. it's very fleshed out and you get to know the city very well throughout the game as you conduct investigations and progress the story. Also Trails at it's core is a fantasy game so seeing the fantasy elements such as monsters and elemental orbments and attacks being merged with a more grounded setting and storyline is quite a unique combination that i haven't seen done much in videogames.The characters are awesome as well and have great chemistry with each other. The main cast is all great with everyone feeling mostly fleshed and enjoyable as characters. My personal favorites were Elie because she's cute and Randy because he is an absolute legend and adds some much needed comedic relief to the group dynamic while also being a very strong and interesting character in his own right.The gameplay is pretty similar to trails in the sky but it has some much needed additions and improvements that make the gameplay a whole lot more fun. I didn't really get bored gameplay wise until around the final dungeon which is a big step up from the sky trilogy where i was bored with the gameplay like 20 hours in.Lastly music. I played the game using the evolution soundtrack and it was amazing. tons of amazing rock and metal stuff with nice saxophone and jazz stuff thrown in too. The music really fit the tone of the world and narrative nicely and made the game much more memorable. Some of my favorites include: ""Inevitable struggle"", ""Surely Someday"" and ESPECIALLY ""get over the barrier"". wonderful soundtrack that i will be putting on my playlistOverall this game is an awesome experience and gets a solid dink approved 8.5/10. It does have some aspects that could be improved but overall it is a must play if you like Jrpgs or just want a good narrative with a unique yet grounded setting.it's also not a bad starting point for new players of the trails series. While certain aspects of the plot definitely won't hit as hard or even make sense as a new player jumping in, overall the narrative explains the callbacks well enough and also has a completely fresh narrative of it's own.so yeah... Play It ;)",positive

The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,"Not recommended first game in the series to play, play after you play the first 3 trails in the sky trilogy!!!That aside, this game is awesome! It concluded the setup from the previous 3 games (trails in the sky) and introduces new mysteries and it is awesome!!!Highly recommended if you are into mature games that doesn't treat their players like a 5 year old and like reading a lot and actually like stories.",positive
The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,"At this point I'm an enfranchised Trails fan, and I've gotta say Trails from Zero is still among my favorite entries into this magnificent franchise! Highly recommend anyone who has played the Sky Trilogy continue their adventure with this new cast of characters in Trails from Zero!",positive
The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,"12 years after it's original Japanese release on the PSP, and an excellent fan translation effort, Trails From Zero has splashed it's way into the west officially!This game had been my favorite 'first story arc game' in the franchise for awhile now until Kuro no Kiseki had dethroned it. I absolutely loved the incredible cast of characters and the setting of Crossbell City, the soundtrack is a banger, and the gameplay elements had been refined from sky trilogy.",positive
The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,I have played the Geofront Fan-Version so disregard my playtime.This is just JRPG goodness from front to back. In hindsight I regret a bit not waiting for this Steam release since it has so many quality of life improvements which really improve the experience.If you're new to the series please play theTrails in the Sky Trilogybefore. They are just as great as this game.I will definitely replay this down the line.,positive
The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,I love Zero (and Azure!). And after playing for a couple hours I can say for certain that this is and will probably forever remain the best version of this game. NISA and PH3 did a great job with this port and localization.,positive
The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,"I gotta tell you. It was perfect, PERFECT, everything, down to to the last minute details.10/10",positive
The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,Great JRPG with some really great high points. I'd do a second playthrough but I have the rest of the games to get to.,positive
The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,"I played this game a couple years ago with the Geofront patch, and I'm happy to see an official release from NISA in 2022, granted it took a bit longer to come out than a lot of fans would've liked. I'm looking forward to revisiting this game, which is a fantastic continuation of the world set up in Trails in the Sky and that it's finally getting released to connect to Trails of Cold Steel and Trails into Reverie.",positive
The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,"Product received for freeThe Crossbell duology finally comes to the west, with a PC version not short of superb made by the people at PH3, surpassing by far the quality of all versions that preceeded it.This and Azure being essential for Trails into Reverie, it's a must-have for any Trails fan that wants to catch up on the story that hasn't yet. Newcomers should take the advice to start from the beginning (which is Trails in the Sky), but this also makes for a decent starting point in the series if you really want to.",positive
The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,"This is a review of bothTrails From ZeroandTrails to Azure. I wanted to finish both before reviewing them, and Iâm glad I did because after Azure, I feel like playing either in isolation rather than together would have been as criminal as Shirleyâs existence.Before getting into it, this statement is directed at anyone who stumbled onto this store-page with no precognition of the Legend of Heroes / Kiseki games. Stop reading and go play Trails in the Sky FC, SC, and 3rd, and make sure you ignore anyone who tells you to skip 3rd or to start with Cold Steel. You will have a far lesser experience if you skip any of the games in this magnificent series, given that the games actively reward you with hype-moments for your dedication. Despite the fact that these games are a separate arc, you are still being rewarded for your participation in the previous games. I will no longer review these games from the perspective of someone new to the series, so enjoy the Sky trilogy, new dude.With that said, time for the boring bit. Zero and Azure continue to iterate and improve on systems established in the previous games. Faster non-boss battles? Check. Earthbound-esque skips for super-weak enemies? Check. Active balance-changes to make crafts less useless than arts? Check. Better visuals, both in aesthetic and even the perspective shifts? Check. Less boring side-quests? Sort of, but they take up less time I found, soâ¦ Check. Overall: Improvements are all over the place, and they didnât fix what wasnât broken, which makes the experience of playing Zero and Azure a great time for those who wanted to experience more than tiny improvements.But since this ainât an Ys game, we donât give a hoot that much about the mechanics as much as we do the presentation and story, man. The setting of Crossbell is the first step towards truly marveling at the world-building of Zemuria in general. By comparison, Liberl is a far larger setting than Crossbell, and yet you feel downrightintimatewith this city by the end of the duology. If youâre familiar with the Yakuza series, you could compare Crossbell to Kamurocho in terms of the way it becomes a character in itself. Youâre going to spend a lot of time in this place, and in many ways, despite the side quests feeling filler in places, you are actively learning information that can help you care about it more. Part of the reason I never invested in the side-quests of FC/SC was because there was this nagging feeling that you were always on the road, and that made caring about the individual branches difficult at best and tedious at worst.Technological advancements are used to great effect as this series plays out, narratively, and theyâre a fantastic piece of the lore that reflects our own progression as idiot-humans on Earth. Thereâs something rather amusing about the characters being introduced to their orbment gadgets (Enigmas) coming with built-in cell-phone functionality, and even later being explained that the Internet is, in fact, a thing; reminds me of my reaction in the 90s when I realized my 56k phone line could allow me to call someone across the world a slur after PKâing them in Diablo. None of this feels unbelievable, either, because weâve known since the Liberl arc that the Epstein Foundation were absolute mad-lads when it came to the continued research and developemtn of orbal tech. These games dare you to deep-dive in their lore like no other JRPG Iâve ever played, and you donât need nostalgia or rose-tinted glasses to do so.Soundtrack is another win, and while I still have a soft spot for 3rd as the peak of the seriesâ OST, there are some fantastic bangers in Zero and Azure. Azure, specifically, pushes some beats that can give you chills at the right timing. While weâre on audio, the Japanese VOs are in a league of their own, here, and the consistency of hearing past characters with their matching voices keeps you feeling like youâre not playing a new sub-series as much as you are continuing a journey, and that journey begins with new, excellent characters.So let me tell you a story: When I finished 3rd, my first thought was: How are they going to keep up with character-writing QA standard? Are we really going to have characters who can compete with the likes of Olivier, Kevin, Ries, and Agate? Can we expect protagonists who can match up to the standard that Joshua and Estelle established? Are we really going to miss the squee of Sieg?Enter Lloyd Bannings, Elie MacDowell, Randy Orlando, and Tio Plato.Despite the fact that you begin the game with them immediately (and I mean immediately after you push new-game) in your party as opposed to the slow-burn of party-acquisition in the trilogy, these four will convince you that character-banter/dialogue is what Falcomâs team excels at, and despite how wacky the plot can be at times, the characters are the soul of this franchise. These dudes feel like the best friends you may or may not have had, growing up, by the time Zeroâs credits hit, and when Azure concluded, they, along with the others joining their journey, feel like a downright family. I had to get a frigginâ metal poster of this cast mid-way because they sold me so hard on their chemistry. I want to gush and talk about a lot of the other cast members, but just know that despite the weight these four have to carry, they are not alone, and not a single protagonist in this duology are allowed to be feel like tag-alongs.Plot-wise: The games are excellent and I found myself caring more about the overall progression, here, than I was in the Sky trilogy. The twist at the end of Azure led me to believe that you absolutely cannot play Zero and not play Azure. Itâs a great moment, and it leads me to now believe that if you ever have a question about something in this franchise? Theyâre going to answer it, which is very commendable, as Iâm quite-frankly sick and tired of modern RPGs shrugging off plot-points, or in the case of Dark Souls story-telling, force you to read descriptions and look up lore videos on YouTube to get your closure. There are a fewâ¦ redheaded hitches along the way, but youâll encounter that and decide for yourself whether it bothers you or not. Itâs not my place toshirleytell you whether you should waifu someone or hope they die.In conclusion, you need to experience these games. If you finished the Sky trilogy, get your butt over to Crossbell and enjoy the ride. You deserve to after completing Liberl.",positive
The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,"After a taking a much longer break than anticipated from the Trails series after playing the Sky trilogy I finally decided to get back into it with Trails from Zero. As with the Sky games, I loved it (Sky 3rd is still my favourite), though with a few caveats.If you've played through any of the other games in the series this won't be a surprise, but boy howdy is it slow. I'm starting to get the general flow of the games, where the first is a long long long (etc etc) set up for the next game where it goes hog wild. Trails to Zero definitely does this better than the first Sky game and has a satisfying conclusion of it's own. But expect to spend 85% of the game doing Bracer missions from the first game, like find Steve's Nan, over and over. Personally I like the chilled vibe and know it's building to something. But it will definitely come from a shock if you are coming from faster moving games.Breaking this up is the combat. If you've played the Sky games you'll know what to expect here. It's turn based, with a focus on pushing your guys up the order and the enemies down it. Using orbaments you can customise your characters with different abilities and arts (magic). The difference this time is the team can use combo crafts, a powerful attack that they execute together. I enjoyed the combat before and enjoyed it here. After a bit of tinkering I had the team set up and working really well, managing to get through some boss battles with them never attacking.It helps that it's enjoyable to spend time with the characters. The four members of SSS are, without fail, great. You spend the entire game with the same SSS crew and watch them build their relationship together. It's really well done and feels natural for the most part. If you have little ability to stomach a bit of anime tropes, you will struggle though, there is a fair bit of suddenly getting stronger through the power of determination. I was so in on the characters that it really didn't bother me at all.So the big question. Do you need to have played the Sky trilogy to play this. Nah I don't think so. There are characters from the previous games here that you won't know and, in particular, one character gets a massive pay off to end her story which you won't have the same reaction to. As long as you are happy with that and not knowing some call backs, you will be 100% fine.Whether you want to start with this, you're coming from the first games or are a battle hardened Trails veteran scoffing at my lack of knowledge, do yourself a favour and play it. Prepare for a long haul, some of it a slog, most of brilliant and hopefully, like me, you'll miss it when it's over.",positive
The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,"I started playing trails from zero late since i started playing from sky to cold steel to kuro no kiseki and only known the cast of zero from cold steel arc at that time i have no idea about the backstory of the characters and after playing trails from zero i can say that i enjoy every bit of the characters/story get to know more about Lloyd and his team tio,elie,randy . Really enjoyed my time playing this game .",positive
The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,"I played this and Azure on an emulator several years ago. While the translations were somewhat botched overall, I managed to tread through both games so I could see how everything interconnected.I'm not exactly the best at extensively and expansively writing out my thoughts, but I believe Crossbell arc's the absolute best out of all of them. Of course, Sky and Cold Steel were also amazing in their own ways, but Crossbell is special and holds dear to my heart.I'm also pleased to see Geofront's efforts weren't in vain and recognized by NISA; I also look forward to Azure for a 2nd time, too.",positive
The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,"The Legend Of Heroes Trails from Zero is the 4th game in the series an is the start of the Crossbell duology. I highly recommend you play through all the Sky trilogy prior to playing otherwise you will be spoiled by the end of a very emotional plot point from Trails in the Sky the 2nd which comes to a close. In Zero you take control the CSPD Special Support Section (SSS). As the name implies the state of the reputation of the CSPD is in shambles and they literally have to fight an uphill battle. As this is the first title in the Crossbell duology it has a slow start as you're introduced to the characters and crossbell as a whole, but by Chapter 2 things pick up and its a great game. The characters, lore, plot development you come to expect from the Legend of Heroes series is here in full force. I highly recommend the game and this series.",positive
The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,"Fantastic game, fantastic port.  Don't let my playtime fool you, I put 140 hours into my Geofront save.  The official release is so thoughtfully done that I was able to plug that old save right into this one and pick it right up.With as much time as I've put into it I'm tempted to start again from scratch just to experience it in Ultrawide and check out the Vita exclusive quests and content that I didn't have the first time through.If you're already into Trails this is a must.  If you're not, I'd recommend starting with Trails in the Sky, but you can absolutely start here too.  A lot of love went into this release and it shows, I'm very excited for Azure early next year.",positive
The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,"Not as good as Trails in the Sky, but still a competently put-together jRPG. It largely just fails to reach the high bar set by Trails in the Sky, having a slightly less charming cast(I genuinely could not care less about Elie), and the writing is simply more... *anime.* If you love anime tropes, you'll love this more, if you find them tedious, you'll love it less.It also lacks that warm feeling of Trails in the Sky where 90% of everyone you met was a nice person and you regularly found yourself helped by... entirely normal people, where it felt like everyone's contribution across Liberl's society was important.Lastly, I know that Trails in the Sky had a few ""you won the battle, but actually he's still pretty strong, so you have to run away/an NPC bails you out,"" but in Trails from Zero it genuinely felt there were more boss battles that terminated this way than there were where you actually won. It got a bit silly, eventually.Still, not a bad game, just not as good as what came before.Also the soundtrack rules, an all-timer, but that's kind of par for the course for Trails games at this point, the soundtrack team always knocks it out of the park.",positive
The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,"Trails from Zero is a very good game. The characters are great, with top marks especially for Randy and Sergei Lou, who at first glance seem pretty shallow but as you get to know them you find out they are anything but.Being the fourth in a long running series, you get the most out of it if you have played the Trails in the Sky trilogy first. However even if you haven't yet played those games, Zero is the beginning of a new story arc in the Trails saga which makes it a decent place to onboard into the series; the cost of which is some slight spoilers/references as to what went down in the previous games, but nothing that would diminish your first play through of those games.If you like JRPGs you definitely should play Trails in the Sky (if you haven't) and you should definitely play Trails from Zero if you have. It's never been a better time to be a fan of the Legend of Heroes: Trails and it's never been a better time to jump on to the franchise if you haven't experienced it yet.",positive
The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,"Great port with many improvements: Redesigned interface, improved graphics. Adjusted the resolution to modern platforms. Appeared a turbo mod. Added voice acting characters from the EVO version.What to expect from the game: Great story and gameplay, thorough characters development, excellent world building, divine soundtrack from Falcom Sound Team jdk.What should scold NIS America for is the regional price. In my region, Trails from Zero costs twice as much as it should, and this is depressing because the company has previously set adequate prices for its games. Seriously, why is a twelve-year-old game costs  more expensive than Trails of cold steel 3 and 4?  It is better to wait for discounts,  I couldn't resist and bought it on the release.Bonus is okay but could be better. Good artbook and soundtrack (only ten tracks unfortunately). It would be better if there was a ten percent discount in the first week (Someday, Surely)",positive
The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,"Already played the Geofront Ver, but this is a very nice upgrade. I'm glad to see NISA put in a good effort the port quality is top notch.",positive

The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,The Trails series is becoming my favorite Jrpg franchise. This one is no exception.,positive

The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,Ah uh I loved it. Cant wait for the sequel. Did you finish the first game? No.,positive
The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,"HOT TAKE: I don't think any of the Trails games have particularly great stories or characters/dialogue.  They're definitely serviceable, but the one thing they DO get right is exactly what you've heard about: the world building.  Trails from Zero is no different, although I think the core cast of this one is rather dull (Lloyd and Elie are basically ALL the JRPG MC tropes, Tio and Randy fare a little better).As for the gameplay itself, this is still quintessential JRPG goodness.  Juicy turn based combat with enough bells and whistles to be engaging throughout, multiple difficulty modes, lots of items and quests, and a lived-in world that is a lot of fun to explore.  Lots of neat little (and big) references to the TITS saga as well for those who have been keeping up from those games.  An unfortunate aspect is the inclusion of one very short bonus dungeon that can only be accessed at the very end of a New Game + run...a trend I keep seeing that I wish would die a quick death.I will dog on this series forever for not living up to it's potential, but I've still had a blast with just about every entry.  Falcom can pretty much do no wrong with games at this point.",positive
The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,"I am buying this game only to leave a positive review. I have played the KAI version on PS4 last year. Liberl arc and Corssbell arc are the best in this franchise. While there are a lot of retcons related to DG Cult in Kuro 1 and 2, it may be good to experience the Crossbell arc again.",positive
The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,"Even though as of now, the regional pricing for Trails from Zero is absurd compared to other Falcom titles at the same or even higher prices, I had to support this excellent release with its superb PC port and localization, aside from it being one of the best Trails entries and best JRPG games out there. My wallet took a hit, but supporting Falcom games is a mission I'll never abandon. I have already played the Joyoland version with the GeoFront patch, so I don't plan to replay the game for the time being. If this is your first time playing an entry from the Trails series, Trails from Zero can be a great place to start!",positive
The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,This should be Legend of Heroes: Trails to QOL. Basically all mechanics are improved from the first game with a great story to boot! If any of my friends are reading this play trails you dumbass.,positive
The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,Steam awards: Labor of love,positive
The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,The Crossbell arc is a good contender for the best entry in the Trails series.And this version of the game is the best way to experience it.,positive
The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,"IntroductionTrails from Zerois the 4th entry in theTrailsseries of story-heavy, turn-based JRPGs. I strongly recommend you play the threeTrails in the Skygames before this one, but they are not mandatory to get an enjoyable experience -Zerois the first in a duology story arc set in its own place with its own characters, but with significant plot points and guest characters shared with the other story arcsTrails in the SkyandTrails of Cold Steel. You will enjoy the world building if you playSky,Zero,AzureandCold Steelin that order, and imports carry across into many of the games. The only parallels I can think of in the west areThe WitcherandMass Effectseries.Please note I will be referencing the sequel arc,Trails of Cold Steel, a fair bit in this review. That is because that arc was released in the west first. Chronologically, this game and its sequelTrails to Azureare set first, so now all the games are out I recommend you play this beforeCold Steel.SettingInTrails from Zeroyou play as Lloyd Bannings, recently qualified police detective who returns to his home city of Crossbell after a short time abroad. As he comes back home he is assigned to the Special Support Section, a new division of the Crossbell Police Department that can operate independently of the main force. This gives Lloyd a lot of leeway in how he goes about matters in Crossbell, foiling crimes, helping the citizenry and investigating corruption and worse. Crossbell is more ""modern"" than the setting of theSkyarc, and the locations surrounding the city can be explored more or less at your leisure (addressing one of the only problems I had with the previous games).SoundThe soundtrack is as big a draw to the game for me as the story. It's just terrific and does so much to set the atmosphere.Inevitable StruggleandFormidable Enemyare two great battle tracks here. There were some good tracks in theSkygames but I feel like Falcom's in-house band, Falcom Sound Team jdk, cut their teeth onZero.GameplayI won't do a full review on this game because it isn't for the casual gamer. If you love story-focused RPGs you'll love this. If you want a casual game to run around in and fight monsters you'll probably bounce off this hard. There's no grinding, there's really not much dungeon crawling, almost all the combat (except for random wilderness mobs) serves the plot.Systems are very similar toTrails in the Sky. You'll have standard melee/ranged weapon strikes alongside crafts, arts and items. The importance of gear, accessories and quartz are just as essential for building your character. There's a bond mechanic with your companions that gets even better in the following games - inZero, it doesn't affect the gameplay as much asCold Steel, but if you got frustrated by how Estelle and Joshua got together without your say so inSky,Zerois much better in player choice in this regard.You'll also get bonuses for accumulating ""Detective Points"", the replacement of Bracer Points from theSkyarc, as well as other fun distractions like a monster book, fishing, cooking etc. If you've playedCold Steelalready you'll recognise these. The NG+ mode is really satisfying as you can choose what bonuses to carry across into each subsequent playthrough for achievement farming.ConclusionTrails from Zerofeels like the game where Falcom really found their footing and knew what they wanted to do with theTrailsseries in general. All the systems in this andAzureare improved on inCold Steel, which is my favourite of the three arcs released in the west so far - but you'll hear a lot of fans say that this is their favourite and I understand why. I think it is because Lloyd is a more straight-forward, less drama-heavy protagonist, the plot is a lot more focused and is particularly smaller scale inZero- like the firstSkygame. I like how the stakes continually rise with each entry in theTrailsseries, but there's less of the world-affecting drama that came in in the later games.I couldn't do this review without mentioning Durante and the PH3 team that did the PC port. Thanks to Geofront,Trails from Zerowas already playable a few years back, but Durante came in with extra QOL features, made the game as stable as a rock, and you can now play this at a high framerate, 4K resolution, better asset textures than on the PSP / PS Vita releases, improved lighting and water shaders and a lot of other configuration to boot. Thank you Falcom, thank you NISA and thank you Durante for your continued dedication to this remarkable series of games.",positive

The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero,"Product received for freeVideo version:YouTubeâ¢ Video:Views: 0Written version below!Another year, another Trails game - except weâre going in reverse since this game actually takes place before the Cold Steel subseries (great games by the way), but Iâm glad we finally get an official release of this in the West.Note: Trimmed to fit Steam, check video for full version!Trails from Zero is the fourth entry in the Trails series, taking place after the Sky subseries. It takes place in Crossbell and introduces us to some important characters that then play a role in the larger story. Coming back from having played the Cold Steel games, it was nice to get a proper introduction to the characters here instead of them just being casually introduced like they were in Cold Steel. Granted, I guess thatâs what I get for playing them out of order to begin with, but then again, this is the first official release of this game in the West soâ¦GameplayZero plays just like any other Trails game. Fast-paced and fun turn-based JRPG combat with a few mechanics to set it aside from the norm, large open worlds to explore full of cool locations to visit and characters to meet, and perhaps the seriesâ largest draw, its expansive and extremely dialogue-heavy storyline full of politics, character relations, action - the full slate.Itâs JRPGs like this that exemplify what I love about the genre, because in spite of its relatively niche appeal, you can tell a lot of heart and effort went into crafting it and I hardly ever feel the time passing when playing these games.StoryThe story here is obviously designed as some sort of prequel or foundation for the following, still unreleased in the West game, Trails to Azure. A lot of the early game is just kinda random missions and even slice of life stuff that I will admit, are a bit slow to build up the cast. If anything, it felt like it was more so written as a way to introduce the location and the different factions and such rather than tell a meaningful story of its own.Granted, I still have not completed the game but itâs been kinda laidback so far, which is disappointing in the way I just described, but also kinda refreshing given the literal info dumping that the last couple Cold Steel games turned out to be. Itâs a double-edged sword of sorts, making it easy to get into the title as a newcomer, but not really offering much as a standalone package if isolated from the rest.Gameplay cont.That said, the gameplay is still some great stuff. Exploring the game world, taking on various quests that usually end in some sort of boss fight, building up your partyâs loadout, and even partaking in the occasional side thing too, like fishing. Itâs a bit formulaic, but again, itâs just nice to have a well-designed overall package even if it doesn't excel in one particular area this time around.PC PortIâve played for about a dozen hours by this point and have had absolutely no issues. I ran the game at 4k 144fps with no drops, freezing, or anything of the sort. I played a lot of that time at 6x game speed too, and once again, I am forever grateful for the turbo mode feature.That and the keyboard and mouse controls are actually pretty good. I would go from playing with a controller to playing with keyboard and mouse and have no issues transferring over. There is proper mouse support both in-game and in the menus and it isnât just some tacked on thing. Very impressive port overall and bonus points for actually including the settings in-game this time instead of in some separate launcher.OverallTrails from Zero has been pretty good so far. I plan on finishing it up and maybe doing a full review, but we'll have to wait and see. Whatever the case, good game, good port, maybe not quite as interesting as other Trails games I have played, but worth a play for fans of the series if you have yet to do so already with the unofficial translations.Follow mySteam Curator Pagefor more reviews + videos!",positive
